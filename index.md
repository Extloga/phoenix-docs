# Phoenix Docs

These are the Design Documents of **Phoenix** (also known as *Project Nyx*), a radically immersive gothic rpg developed by [PhoenixTales](https://phoenixtales.de) and based on Gothic by Piranha Bytes. Here you find all our research and planning based on the original vision of Gothic (which had *Phoenix* as its working title) that we preserve and present in our [Gothic Archive](https://gothicarchive.org). 

The docs are work in progress, they are currently rewritten and will be unlocked over time. Due to ongoing work on the order and internal structure of docs, the index below will change.

## Lore
1. Mythology (Archaic Times from Creation Myths to the Holy Enemy Prophecy)
2. Geography (Overview of the Kingdom and the World)
3. Culture (Cults, Priests, Temple, Estates, Sex, Languages)
4. MetaPhysics (Worldviews, Gods and Demons, Magical Ore, Drugs, Magic)
5. History (History of Myrtana till the beginning of the Game -> end with timeline)

-> Deep Lore and Background Overview, then after showing
   the Outside World and having context for the Colony,
   dealing with the specific Gameworld as our stage:

## World
1. Camps (Camp Description, Camps important places and my design reasoning)
2. Guilds 
3. NPCs
4. Monsters
5. Items

-> Deep Dive into the Setting, the World, its Characters and Enemies.
   To then build the story on top of that and weave it like a net
   between all those camps, guilds, npcs, monsters, items:



## Design
1. Interface (Between player and player character)
2. Gameplay (What is the player doing in the game?)
3. Technical Stuff / Engine ...
4. Artstyle (How is the game supposed to look? Including Aesthetic Research)
