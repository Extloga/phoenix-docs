# Enter the Concept

Welcome to the desert of the ideal.  
These are the Design Documents of [PHOENIX](https://phoenixthegame.com) (working title "Project Nyx"), a radically immersive action rpg developed by Phoenix Tales, based on GOTHIC by Piranha Bytes which had "Phoenix" as its working title.   

In the early stages of development we created what later would become the [Gothic Archive](https://gothicarchive.org) by collecting as much pre-release material as possible to research the original vision of what we summarise as the "Gothic Alpha". In course of this work we decided to prepare and present it in form of a website for the community.  

All the research of said material and our own game design derived from it are extensively documented in the design concept at hand and in the same way as we made our Archive public source portal we have decided to release our design docs as well in form of a website. It is our own minimal online documentation solution, where the index serves as the navigation.  

Documents are written in markdown and automatically formated to HTML, often complemented by appended spreadsheets. It is easy to contribute [via git](https://github.com/PhoenixTales/phoenix-docs), thus everyone can collaborate with us in our research.  

Since we target an international audience and are an international team from Germany, Poland, Romania, Czechia and with associations to Ukraine, Russia and Slovakia, we write the documentation in english.  

A long-term goal is a physical publication of the concept after the release of the game.

<p class="subtext blueinfo">Please note that the Design Concept is an ongoing documentation of the project since 2016. It is <strong class="demonic">work in progress</strong>. Many documents are currently rewritten and will be unlocked over time. Just plot documents will not be published before the release of the game. Due to the current work on the order and internal structure of documents, regular changes to the index are to be expected.</p>


## Document Structure

Currently the documentation is structured in the following categories:  

```
1. Vision 
2. Mechanics
3. Story
    3.1 Setting
    3.2 World
    3.3 Plot
    3.5 Relations
    3.6 Missions
4. Promotion
5. Behind the Scenes
5. Behind the Scenes
APPENDIX 
* Promotion
* Behind the Scenes
* Inspirations
* Credits
```

Whenever a topic has a source in design documents, old builds of the game or both our documentation is structured in an "Alpha" and a "Phoenix" section:  

```
(1) Research of how aspect X was planned  
(2) Concept for realisation of X in Phoenix
```
