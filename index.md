# Enter the Concept

Welcome to the desert of the ideal.

These are the Design Documents of [PHOENIX](https://phoenixthegame.com) (working title "Project Nyx"), a radically immersive action rpg developed by PhoenixTales, based on GOTHIC by Piranha Bytes (which had "Phoenix" as its working title). 

In the early stages of development we created what later would become the [Gothic Archive](https://gothicarchive.org) by collecting as much pre-release material as possible for our research of the "GOTHIC Alpha" vision. In course of this work we decided to prepare and present it in form of a website for the community.  

All this research of said material and all our planning derived from it is extensively documented in the design concept at hand. In the same way as we made the Archive public we also have decided to realise our design docs in form of a website, in which the index serves as the navigation. A long-term goal is a physical release.  

Since we target an international audience and are an international team from Germany, Poland, Romania, Czechia and with associations to Ukraine, Russia and Slovakia, we write the documentation in english.



The website is made from scratch and is our own minimalist documentation solution. Most documents are written in markdown and automatically formated into HTML, often complemented by appended spreadsheets. This makes it easy for others to contribute (via GitHub) and everyone can collaborate with us in our research.  

<p class="subtext blueinfo">Please note that the Design Concept is an ongoing documentation of the project that is being written since about 2015. It is <strong class="demonic">work in progress</strong>. Many documents are currently rewritten and will be unlocked over time. Plot documents will not be unlocked before release to avoid unnecessary spoilers. Due to the current work on the order and internal structure of documents, regular changes to the Index are to be expected.</p>

The documentation follows the following structure:  

1. Vision 
2. Mechanics
3. Story
    3.1 Setting
    3.2 World
    3.3 Plot
    3.5 Relations
    3.6 Missions
4. Promotion
5. Behind the Scenes

Appendix



Vision: General research and project overview. Mechanics: Everything about the gameplay. Story: Setting, Lore, World Design, the plot divided into two acts, our comprehensive system of relationships between all entities and missions from the Alpha and those derived from said system. Promotion: All kinds of promotional material like Screenshots, press coverage, as well as our promotional planning or roadmap. Behind the Scenes: Essays by the devs, insights into the team, development processes, the connection with former Gothic developers and so on. Inspiration: A collection of all the inspirations (known to us) of the original devs and of our own.  

Whenever a topic has a source in design documents, actual builds of the game or both, our documentation is structured as follows:  

(1) Research of how aspect X was planned  
(2) Concept for realisation of X in Phoenix  

... extensively documented in our design concept (short "Phoenix Docs") presented here in digital form, in which the index serves as the navigation.
