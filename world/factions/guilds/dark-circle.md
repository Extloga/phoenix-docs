    Circle of Darkness

    Kreis der Nacht
    KdN fits best I guess.

## Attire

As an inspiration and basis for further design exploration we can take the grey, dark robe from 0.64b and the unused almost black mage concept by ralf from the Artbook with the big, silver amulet on the chest. 

We can also consider the mage robe concept art that was done for G4, but this may serve better as a robe for when the player joins the dmb or when slightly changed as a basis for the mystics. 
Since the sign of Beliar in the temple is shown in purple, purple or the usage of dark blue and dark red in combination could work well for the Priests of Beliar, but here too it may be better reserved for the Mystics because it is them who kind of mix all of the circles by despising their distinction and the different schools and taking whatever knowledge they can find of both.

The same colour scheme of mixing red/blue/purple is *also* used in the alpha Watermages robe. This can be seen as a hint to us as to how to use this robe in the game: The robe from the alpha with all the purple in it, should be assigned to Saturas as the disciple of the DMB, while other, more blue variations should be used by the other mages. [TODO: Add to the character description or KDW Guild document.]

But then there also would be green, a so far very unused colour in the game, which would be justified *if*, for instance, the cult of Beliar would more often meet and have its cultic places in the forest; if Beliar is a strong connection to the earth and so on, a dark green may fit well too. If his primary colour is black, at least green accents can be added, similar to the red accents in Xardas robe. 

It would also be possible to... give Xardas in Phoenix his alpha robe only from Ralfs concepts and/or Wittmanns descriptions, while his release robe may primarily serve as a basis for the Beliar Priests (maybe with less accentuated shoulders). The design of the concept robe may serve better to show it being his former fire mages robe. 

Bones may play a role.

Their primary symbol is the moon. The moon and other beliar related imagery may appear in form of tapestry, in form of amulets, candlesticks, carvings and so forth. 

They may use some form of face paint. But they should clearly be able to differentiate from characters which are more druidic in appearance.
