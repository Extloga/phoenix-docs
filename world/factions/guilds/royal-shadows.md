* The Shadows are secret spies of the King. No one knows who is one. 
* While the Inquisition searches for heretics both among citizens and even among priests and the Royal Guard, the Shadows search for traitors and conspiracies.
* They are absolutely secret. Before Rhobar II they were just a legend. And to this day only the King and the highest level Royal Guards know who is a Shadow.
* They are a bit like the Inquisition, but have nothing to do with the cult, religion, magic or demons, they're about spies, conspiracies, national safety etc.
* Just like CIA and FBI are a bit of rivals stepping on each others toes even though they work for the same government, there may be a bit of rivalry in some overlapping investigations between inquisition and Shadows.
