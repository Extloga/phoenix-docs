* Called Priests of Beliar, Beliar priests, priests of Vandras (older name of Beliar), Beliari or "Vandrani".

Just as Innos is associated with sound and in general with the "light of the senses", so is Beliar associated with silence and darkness, with the withdrawal of the senses. The withdrawal of the senses will be the essential characteristic of the design of the beliar priests.

The Beliar priests are wearing simple hats that are covering their ears, sheer blindfolds, veils or masks covering their eyes or sometimes their whole face. Why did I decide so? For various reasons. 

* On the earliest concept by Ralf the demon summoner is shown with a blindfold.
* Beliar stands for justice: Madame Justitia wears a blindfold too, as she is not allowed to judge based on superficial grounds.
* In the same way the black guard of the Inquisition, (seeing themselves as earthly executors of beliars justice) cover their eyes with a metal visor.

Therefore, it is crucial for the Beliar priests to be presented accordingly.

But there is more to it: 
* It is a stance against individualism, and individualism in the sense of a fear of loosing ones self can be associated with the fear of the people from the night and the neglect of Beliar and his principles that led to Beliar creating death to force them to accept his truth.
* The beliar cult is arguing that much suffering is caused by the peoples neglect of this crucial second side of life; they appreciate the bright side, the outside, the light, but not the dark, the inside, the night.
* A Beliar priest is like a living example and a slap into the face of ordinary people who always reminds them of death, of the possibility of ending, of the need to explore their internal life too and so on. 
* Relation to others: Some people are afraid and aversed from them due to this, because they do not want to be reminded of death and of whats going on deep inside of them. They run away from it. Others are attracted to them as they find no sense and meaning in the outside.
