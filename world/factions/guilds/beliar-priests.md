Just as Innos is associated with sound and in general with the "light of the senses", so is Beliar associated with silence and darkness, with the withdrawal of the senses. The withdrawal of the senses will be the essential characteristic of the design of the beliar priests.

The Beliar priests are wearing simple hats that are covering their ears, sheer blindfolds, veils or masks covering their eyes or sometimes their whole face. On the earliest concept by Ralf the demon summoner is shown with a blindfold. Beliar stands for justice: Madame Justitia wears a blindfold too, as she is not allowed to judge based on superficial grounds. In the same way the black guard of the Inquisition, (seeing themselves as earthly executors of beliars justice) cover their eyes with a metal visor. Therefore, it is crucial for the Beliar priests to be presented accordingly.
