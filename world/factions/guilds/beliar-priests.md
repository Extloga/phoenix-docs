**Name:** Called Priests of Beliar, Beliar priests, priests of Vandras (older name of Beliar), alternatively "Beliari" or "Vandrani". In the german original we may refer to them as "Beliarpriester", "Vandranische Priester" etc.

**Female Priests:** There is a significant percentage of female priests within the Beliar cult (few in the Adanos cult, none in the Innos cult), which tells something about the perception of woman and man in Myrtana (at least in tradition). The woman as bound more to the earth, as pointing downwards to the acknowledgement of our material nature, grounded in that nature; man as oriented towards heaven, pointing upwards to the sky, to the acknowledgement of our spiritual or transcendental nature; grounded in ideals. Obviously both is needed in union in order to materialise the spirit, in order to spiritualise the materia, to realise ideals and to "idealise" reality. But as one has been considered higher than the other and there was an exaggerated focus and identification of the physical male and female form with these internal principles, men started to look down upon women in course of the tides. 


## Visual Design

Just as Innos is associated with sound and in general with the "light of the senses", so is Beliar associated with silence and darkness, with the withdrawal of the senses. The withdrawal of the senses will be the essential characteristic of the design of the beliar priests.

Therefore in their visual design we will put emphasis on these aspects of silence, of darkness, of earth, of going down and inside/retract instead of rising above and outside/unfold. 

Thus the Beliar priests often will wear dark earthen-coloured robes, sometimes made from archaic materials like unusually rough plant fibers, wood, bones and often fur. Most of the time they are wearing simple hats that are covering their ears, sheer blindfolds, veils or masks covering their eyes and sometimes their whole face.

Additional reasoning: 

* On the earliest concept by Ralf the demon summoner is shown with a blindfold.
* Beliar stands for justice: Madame Justitia wears a blindfold too, as she is not allowed to judge based on superficial grounds.
* In the same way the black guard of the Inquisition, (seeing themselves as earthly executors of beliars justice) cover their eyes with a metal visor.

Therefore, it is crucial for the Beliar priests to be presented accordingly. Basically, they do "not have a face", they are radically rejecting their personality, at least it is this where their traditional clothing is coming from (obviously there will as well be many priests just dressed in pride).  
Thus...

* It is a stance against individualism, and individualism in the sense of a fear of loosing ones self (and identification with the persona) can be associated with the fear of the people from the night and the neglect of Beliar and his principles that led to Beliar creating death to force them to accept his truth.
* The beliar cult is arguing that much suffering is caused by the peoples neglect of this crucial second side of life; they appreciate the bright side, the outside, the light, but not the dark, the inside, the night.
* Thereby a beliar priest is acting as a living example of this rejection and in resistance against this general "fault" the sin against the dark, as they see it. His looks is a slap into the face of ordinary people who always reminds them of death, of a possible and inevitable end, of the need to explore the internal life instead or alongside of conquering the outside world and so on. 
* Relation to others: Some people are afraid and aversed from them due to this, because they do not want to be reminded of death and of whats going on deep inside of them. They run away from it. Others are attracted to them as they find no sense and meaning anymore in the outside or as they are banned from the world and forced into hiding due to their crimes or their difference, for which they receive hatred and exclusion from society.
