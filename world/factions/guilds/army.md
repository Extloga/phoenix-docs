# Army

*Their uniformity lies in their armour, equipment, manner and signs, not in the colours of their tunics and other details.*

* **Tunic:** Soldiers wear different coloured tunics as available. Sometimes small units of 5-10 soldiers try to match in style, but tunics are always individual if not in colour then still in degree of colour fading, signs of repair etc. Red is preferred (the lighter red as created by the madder root), but often naturally coloured linen or wool is used. Brown wool and off-white linen is common, green and red are seen sometimes, scarlet and purple are rare and mostly used by generals and richer units. Royal blue is the most rare and only used by the king/throne guard.
* **Scarves:** Soldiers wear scarves in the same style as the blue scarves of the scraper's union, by which the latter presents itself as an opposing "army of workers" against the king, which weapon is the pickaxe (and the sickle in case of the peasants who support the union). 
* **Coat:** Every soldier has a brown woolen coat (Sagum), generals may have a scarlet coat; depending on the weather some may be seen wearing it being completely covered in it, also covering their heads. Some may be seen just wearing it as a cape with most of the frontside exposed. Others are seen carrying it over one shoulder like buddhist monks carry their outer robe. 
* **Dagger:** Every soldier has a dagger on his right side as a backup weapon.
* **Sword:** The army carries short swords.

* When a soldier (royal army, pal) is walking, he always has to be heard by the sound of the jingling belts they wear and depending on the floor by the sound of his nailed boots; both may be solved by extra footstep sounds for soldiers.
