* The factions with their domains are fighting for domination over the domains of other factions.
* The player can decide to work for one faction or another, serving the interest of one faction against others and gets involved in conflicts of interest.
* At some points in the story, a faction may take control over a domain previously controlled by another faction; which can be dependent or totally independent of the actions of the player.
