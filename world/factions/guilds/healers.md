Introduced in the Sequel, they are internally described as Healers and "Medici" (singular Medicus).

Their sign, worn as an amulet, may appear like a mixture of a "fußgespartes Kreuz", but inverted, making it basically a "kopfgespartes Kreuz", with a cross potent (Krückenkreuz). But the upper part is so small that it seems to merely serve as the connection to the chain, thus, it is essentially the "T" that remains, with crossbars at its three ends (instead of four as in the full cross potent) and with a little circle around the connection of the two beams, similar to the celtic cross.

The cross potent was used already in neolithic times both in Europe and ancient China (where it is related with the modern chinese character with the meaning of "shaman, witch" and the old chinese shamanic traditions). In the context of Gothic Magic the cross is associated with healing, but the cross potent specifically is used on the Uriziel Rune "Wave of Death".

The "T" in our lore is the sign of the Inquisition, representing the T-shaped beam construction on which heretics were burned and thereby "redeemed".

In the context of Gothic Magic the "T" appears on teleportation runes and scrolls.
And it is also the very same T-shape the character raises his arms into when casting the teleportation spell.
