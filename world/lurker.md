In the release version of Gothic, Lurker and Snapper are two different creatures with no relation to each other. Originally they were one and the same.

In order to understand our design decisions in regard to these two monsters, we have to go back to the beginning and explain how they came to being.

The original idea was to have a water monster, such as a crocodile. But just as with almost all the other monster designs, the idea was to divert from common fantasy universes as well as from reality by a more unique design. 

It would swim and dive in the water and attack the player when swimming. And when the player would walk by some pond, he would suddenly "snap" out of the water with a jump attack to get him and pull him into the water. Therefore, this monster was called "Snapper".

Due to this idea for the monster, as being in the water, but close to the water's edge and as being able to jump, Vadim, who was initially responsible for the monster design, came up with the idea of a giant frog with sharp teeth. The frog made sense because he could jump and his legs have developed accordingly. 

But for some reasons unknown to us, this design was discarded. The initial idea of a giant frog was developed into the Orc Dog from the Alpha, the "mouth on legs" (see Orc Dog). And as the water monster, called Snapper at the time, this monster was designed instead:

The snapper was blue, as he was in the water. He had big hind legs to jump and overall he looked more like the Snapper of the release version.

But this approach was discarded too and a new monster was designed: the Lurker. Like the Snapper, the Lurker was meant to be blue and only come at land to attack (please be aware that of course this blue texture was a placeholder). He had similarly large hind legs, but bigger front legs too, walking on all fours, the head and mouth was given a more elongated shape. Overall, the Lurker brought the design a bit closer to a crocodile, the "regular" water monster that they wanted to divert from in form of a unique fantasy design, but with longer legs due to the jumping idea - a crocodile cannot jump.

As the Lurker replaced the Snapper as the water monster, they didn't want to ommit the original Snapper idea and developed it into what is known from the release version. Since he was not in the water anymore the blue colour didn't fit and so the design was basically changed into that of a regular (to not say boring) dinosaur (as imagined at the time and as presented e.g. in Jurassic Park). In this aspect they diverted for the first time from their own goal of not having too common real or fantasy monsters.

But then, in course of development, the idea of a monster diving and attacking the player inside of the water as well as the idea of jumping/snapping out of the water couldn't be realised, be it due to technical complications or lack of time or both. This was basically the end of the whole idea of the water monster. 

In consequence the Lurker too was put on the land, at the edges of water, opposed to the very idea inspiring his name of "lurking" inside of the water. And like the Snapper his skin was also changed in colour to a tone more akin to the beaches at which he would hang around.

## Summary

To summarise: The very idea of a water monster inspired both the Snapper and the Lurker, but in the end none of them fulfilled what they were meant to do. Due to this development, whatever the reasons may be, we ended up with two monsters that did not fulfill their purpose. Neither did we end up with a monster that would *snap* out of the water like a frog, nor did we end up with a monster that would silently *lurk* in the water like a crocodile. 

We got two very different monsters instead, one a stereotypical dinosaur, one a halfway unique creature that doesn't know if it wants to be a crocodile or a frog and sounds like a dragon. To make it short: I am not convinced.
