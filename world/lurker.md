In the release version of Gothic, Lurker and Snapper are two different creatures with no relation to each other. Originally they were one and the same.

In order to understand our design decisions in regard to these two monsters, we have to go back to the beginning and explain how they came to being.

The original idea was to have a water monster, such as a crocodile. But just as with almost all the other monster designs, the idea was to divert from common fantasy universes as well as from reality by a more unique design. 

It would swim and dive in the water and attack the player when swimming. And when the player would walk by some pond, he would suddenly "snap" out of the water with a jump attack to get him and pull him into the water. Therefore, this monster was called "Snapper".

Due to this idea for the monster, as being in the water, but close to the water's edge and as being able to jump, Vadim, who was initially responsible for the monster design, came up with the idea of a giant frog with sharp teeth. The frog made sense because he could jump and his legs have developed accordingly. 

But for some reasons unknown to us, this design was discarded. The initial idea of a giant frog was developed into the Orc Dog from the Alpha, the "mouth on legs" (see Orc Dog). And as the water monster, called Snapper at the time, this monster was designed instead:
