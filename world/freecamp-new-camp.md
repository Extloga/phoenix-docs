### Free Camp & New Camp

The specifics of the design of the camps themselves are dealt with in the corresponding documents, here we will only talk about their position.

During the Orpheus phase the New Camp was always shown in the southwest. It happened during the involvement of Ralf, during the restart of the project under its new working title "Phoenix" that it switched its place with the Free Camp and was modeled in the northwest. The connection of the New Camp with the peasants on the fields at the foot of the "Old Castle" in the south was prevalent in the Orpheus phase and in Alex Wittmann's story, but was soon developed further into the idea of the rice terraces, which was crucial to give the Camp its design both on Ralfs concepts and in form of the ingame models of the camp. We do not have any concept of the New Camp as Mike imagined it to be and we assume that there was none. The cooperation with Ralf has given the Camp its character (through several iterations), but the rice terraces and the dam and thus the waterfall and the connection with the river were the one thing that all the concepts had in common, based on Mikes own sketch that he made at some point after the Orpheus Map V1. 

We have to realise that by this reposition of the camp we lost the connection of the fields to the original Old Castle (AK), which suggested that the peasants and the fields may have been there already before the New Camp and that by founding the New Camp at this territory, Lee was thereby also occupying this land and governing the peasants, which may have choosen to join him more or less deliberately, which would explain why before coming up with any other name for him, he is always just called the "Lord" in the documents. He is the lord over this land in the West of the colony and the lord of the peasants working there for his men and the circle of water. 


But after the re-invention of the camp as being nourished not by regular fields, but by the rice fields, which were only possible to set up throught he construction of the dam, this conception of the faction was apparently changed deliberately; it emphasized their focus on self-sustainability to overcome any dependence from and refuse any cooperation with the outside world. 
In this context it did not really make any difference for the New Camp neither for the setting, nor the story nor stylistically, that it was moved further up towards the northwest and basically switched places with the Free Camp, because the dam and the rice terraces were build alongside the New Camp; a connection with the old castle did thus not seem reasonable anymore. 

But it *did* make a difference for the Free Camp at least in so far that the Free Mine was always supposed to have a connecton to the Abandoned Mine. Moving the Free Mine much further into the south (and simultaneously the Abandoned Mine further north and east) of course did not mean that such a connection could not anymore exist, but if so it had to be different than what was imagined originally, since the distance was increased immensely. But according to the story documents this connection does not seem to have been given up alongside these changes of the layout. And it doesn't have to be. 

Apart from that, we do not know any world model in which the world was modeled according to the former layout, the New Camp was in the northwest and the Free Camp in the southwest in the earliest world models we are aware of. It is this layout that the players knew from all existing demos and screenshots before release. Therefore we do not see a reason to change this.

The positional change of the Free Mine cannot be seen independent from the positional change of the Old Mine though. Because the new position of the Old Mine in the north east reminds of the location where the Free Mine was always supposed to be on the earlier concepts of the map and is just as close to the New Camp, if not closer, then the Free Camp that is actually connected to it. 

-> For us, just an additional reason against the new position of the Old Mine. Since as it is now, the Old Mine is *closer* to the New Camp than it is to the Old Camp.
