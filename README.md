# README

The Phoenix Docs were written by  
Flosha, Logx, Arbax & Avallach.  

2016-2022 PhoenixTales  

**Last Update:** 24.11.2022  

Design Documents of **Phoenix** (also known as *Project Nyx*), a radically immersive gothic rpg developed by [PhoenixTales](https://phoenixtales.de) and based on Gothic by Piranha Bytes. Here you find all our research and planning based on the original vision of Gothic (which had *Phoenix* as its working title) that we preserve and present in our [Gothic Archive](https://gothicarchive.org). 

The docs are work in progress, they are currently rewritten and will be unlocked over time. Plot documents won't be unlocked before release. Due to ongoing work on the order and internal structure of docs, regular changes to the Index are to be expected. We plan for a physical print of the docs when we're done.
