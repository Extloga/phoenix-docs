## Phoenix - A Gothic Tale

PHOENIX is a dark fantasy drama, narrated like a greek tragedy with the game world serving as its stage. Designed as a melancholic virtual tale and a philosophical reflection with different plots depending on the decisions and the playstyle of the player. An immersive sim set in a mystic valley full of conflict, decay and atmospheric density. Everything is designed by hand and comes with unique aesthetics and lovely retro graphics, while the gameplay is focused on immersion by visualisation: No numbers, no statistics, just roleplay.

It is currently in development by [PhoenixTales](https://phoenixtales.de), a small and non-commercial indie team. We work on it since 2016. Done when it's done. 


## Phoenix - A Gothic (Alpha) Reboot

PHOENIX is based on and conceived as an independent and non-commercial Reboot of GOTHIC&trade; by Piranha Bytes. It is inspired by the original vision of GOTHIC of which only fragments have been realised. We see the game as it was primarily as a proof of concept of what it could have been - which is what we want PHOENIX to be. GOTHIC had *Phoenix* as its working title and thus we have chosen it as the name for this project under which we aspire to realise this initial vision with its radical potential.  

In course of the development of PHOENIX we have created the [Gothic Archive](https://gothicarchive.org) to preserve and to present this inherited vision that we are curating since. We have been provided diverse pre-release material such as design documents, concept arts and alpha builds that we provide to the public in return, insofar we're allowed to.  

All these ressources and the underlying design philosophy and artstyle is analysed in a collective effort of "alpha research" and developed further by us, consequently and without compromises, documented in our [Phoenix Concept]().  

<p class="subtext">Please note, PHOENIX is not an official game of the GOTHIC franchise, it's a non-commercial project by a small indie team (PhoenixTales) and a pure labour of love.</p>

The Phoenix Design Concept (short the "Phoenix-Docs") is a comprehensive documentation of every aspect of the project and is presented here in digital form, where the index serves as the navigation. Since we target an international audience and are an international team the docs are written in english. We plan for a physical release of the docs when we're done.  

<p class="subtext">Note: *Everything* is work in progress. The docs are currently rewritten and will be unlocked over time. Plot documents will not be unlocked before release. Due to the current ongoing work on the order and internal structure of the documents regular changes to the Index are to be expected.</p>
