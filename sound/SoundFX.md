## Specific Motifs

As researched by Dmitriy, in early 1999 specific music motifs were introduced, at least one of which was implemented as early as in version 0.56c, which plays a sound when an item is found. The only sounds of that kind who remained in the release version of the game were the sounds for diary entries, level ups and chapter changes.  

The following music motifs represented by sound effects were planned:  

* Death
* Resurrection
* Found Item
* Solved Mission / Failed Mission
* Killed Enemy / Killed Big Enemy
* Level Gain
* Attitude Increase / Decrease
* Trap Activate
* Steal Fail
* Refresh Mana / Health / Psi
* Health Low


### Phoenix' Motifs

In Phoenix, some of the sound effects mentioned above will only be played under specific conditions, since it might be annoying if the same sound would play with, e.g. every killed enemy. But we also have a few additional ones like "found secret" (inspired by the secrets in retro shooters) or "Low Mana" and "Low Psi" (suggested by Dmitriy) to supplement our enhanced visualisation. Thus we will go with the following effects:

* Death / Resurrection
* Found Artefact / Found Secret
* Killed Enemy (first) / Big Enemy (boss)
* Log Entry
* Mission Solved / Mission Failed
* Level Gain (equals new chapter)
* Attitude Increase / Decrease
* Trap Activate
* Steal Fail
* Refresh Health / Mana / Psi
* Low Health / Mana / Psi
