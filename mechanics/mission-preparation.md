We want that the player is not just going from one mission to another, but that he takes some time to plan a mission based on the informations gained. 

[1] Information Search:
To this end he first has to acquire information through inquiry or via paid informants etc. In some cases he may receive a rough sketch of a map for the building or area he is about to infiltrate; he may receive a tip and a mark on his map (in the style of Thief) and so on.

* One may gain informations by paying an informant or by offering services in exchange for information
* One may enforce disclosure of information by violence or threat (e.g. Warriors and Battlemages), by reading minds or mental force (Psionics)
* One may acquire information by theft, listening, espionage etc. (Thieves)

[2] Inventory Limitation:
Another factor in the mission preperation is the limited inventory. By limiting what he can take with him, he has to choose by tactical considerations and prepare a "loadout" in the style of Thief and Splinter Cell. But not in a loadout screen before a mission, but immersively at a safeplace, e.g. at the players own hut, at a weapons dealers place (think of Mafia 1), at a befriended alchemists hideout etc. 

[3] Save Restrictions:
Finally, mission preparation and thinking ahead is additionally promoted by saving being restricted to safezones in normal playmodes (see Playmodes). By linking the location where the player is factually "safe" with the ability "to save", all the explorations outside of the safe zones become actually dangerous in accordance with the game's premise.
