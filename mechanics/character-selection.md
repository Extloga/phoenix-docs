*Can you choose a model and skin for the main character, or is there a set person you must use?*
**Alex:** Yes, it's a set person, but hey, it's our HERO! Choosing a skin at the beginning wouldn't make much sense, because you will find dozens of different clothing and armor later in the game that you can use. But if you like you can try to solve the game in your underwear instead
**Mike:** There still is the idea of letting the player choose one of several different faces at the beginning...

**Mike:** You'll alway start with the same Character. He's a noname Level 1 character with no specifications at all (perhaps we'll let the player choose his facial texture). During the first hours of the game, you'll initiate your character depending on what quests you take (and succeed in!). So the game becomes the character generation.
