# Keep your distance

*flosha, 28.07.2025*

As an additional ambient detail, if the player goes and stands too close to someone (specific value), and then initiates a dialogue.

* If the npc is weaker and afraid of him, when the dialogue is initiated, the NPC will make a step back, before the conversation starts, without saying anything. 
* When the character is a friend or about the same level and friendly, he raises his arm towards the other and makes a small step back, saying something like "hey", or "why so close?" or "keep some distance."
* When the NPC is neutral or angry and stronger, more powerful than the PC, he will push the PC back with two arms, so that the PC stumbles two steps backwards and the NPC says something like: "Too close!" or "What is wrong with you?" or "Keep off of me" Or "Are you gay?" or "Distance!"

Important: Consider problems that thid feature could create. E.g. don't do it if they stand somewhere or in a way that one of them would then fall down somewhere etc.
