*How exactly does the mana system work for casting spells?*
**Mike:** Mana regenerates automatically. I see no point in carrying around 100 mana-potions, so regeneration will be quite fast. We still have potions (very rare and very expensive), but they'll boost you OVER your actual maximun! (3dgaming.net, 30.07.1999)


*Will mages have different choices as far as what types of magic they can specialize in?*
**Mike:** Yes! (Wonderful, isn't it?) You will be able to choose from 2 philosophies of magic. The White Magic uses whatever means to destroy the enemies. The Grey Ones try to keep the balance and therefore don't use mega-destructive spells, but their subtile means of solving their problems are no less efficient! (3dgaming.net, 30.07.1999)


Psionics:

*Will the characters specializing in psionics be able to persuade NPCs to do their bidding?*
**Mike:** Yes.
**Tom:** What else can I say? (3dgaming.net, 30.07.1999)


*How often can a player use psionic powers, and what types of limitations are imposed on their use?*
**Alex:** The use of psionic powers depends on your will-power. You can refresh this psionic power by using meditation. (3dgaming.net, 30.07.1999)


**Mike:** There are 15 different kinds of spells, many of them have different levels and will not only become stronger, but will alter they effects! We didn't create dozens of spells, because imho you don't need that much. If you've got fireball at the same mana cost than magic missile, why using magic missile anymore? In GOTHIC, spell upgrades only have advantages and therefore replace the former spell. Imo, the coolest spells are shapeshift (works with several creatures, you'll get the special abilities of the creature), lightning (there is something to learn about it :)) and control mind (which leaves you motionless and defenseless while you control a humanoid being - if you've got the mental strength, that is). Shapeshift is a good example of how even a small number of spells could generate a multitude of possibilities. As you can transform into most of the animals in GOTHIC, your tactical possibilities become greater the more crearures you learn to shift into. Are you a small meatbug? Then nobody probably will recognize you sneaking around. Or are you a huge shadowbeast - a superb fighter with only 1 disadvantage - bright light (like torches, etc) will dazzle you! There are quite some things to find out about the other creatures of GOTHIC... (glideunderground.com 16.10.1999)
