# Driven by Story

Phoenix is promoted by us as a "story-driven rpg" and so was Gothic. But what does this even mean? 

A game driven by story is (1) not a film with passages of interactivity, but a simulated story in a simulated world with simulated A-life the player can constantly interact and interfere with. And this interactivity should be consistent in the game logic, which we may call "interaction consistency": What NPCs can do, the player character in theory must also be able to do and vice versa.

In this sense, a game like Hellblade, as much value it may have for what it is, is simply less of a game than Gothic. It may be an experience with much *focus* on the story with some degrees of interactivity, but if something could work just as well as a film, then it is not much of a game. And even if the interactivity adds something to the experience, it remains a very restricted form of interactivity broken up by constant cutscenes and would thus be better described as an interactive movie than a game.

What is not interactive is not *played*. The more a game is playable the more game it is, the more it utilises the potential of a videogame as a medium. 

This understanding of what a game should be forms the basis to several design decisions regarding our gameplay. But what makes this gameplay *story-driven*?

In consequence of a believable simulated stage of this gothic drama Phoenix has to be, the story and the world as the stage of the story should evolve on their own, if the player interferes with it or not.

In that a game is story driven, it is of course pre-narrated to a high degree, but not in a linear way, but in what we may call a multi-dynamic-simultaneous narrative. It is...

(1) "multi" because the player can choose several pre-narrated paths with a few different branchings during gameplay.

(2) "dynamic" because the world and the other characters do not wait for the player. The story progresses (in parts) independent from the player's actions. In the most extreme case a playthrough may *end* and the player is too late. 

(3) "simultaneous" in that NPCs play a role in the story too. And in some cases they play a role that the player may have played under other circumstances (had he joined another camp and guild); since the world and story are simulated in real time he cannot be at two locations at once, he will necessarily be at point X while something happens at point Y, so that other NPCS will interfere with the story simultaneous to the player.

NPCs will receive the very mission that the player would otherwise receive if playing for that faction or guild and may then be confronted with this character and his endeavours from another perspective.

In telling a story in or through a game, there are two diametrically opposed approaches in what drives the story forward: 

It is one approach, as used most often, including in Gothic itself, that the game world and story are waiting for the player to trigger specific conditions and thereby initiate story events. 

And then there is the possibility of a completely opposite approach: Events unfold on their own. They are also, but not *only* driven by the actions of the player, which serves as only one small factor among the actions of all the other (non-player) main characters in the game. Thus there are events that occur completely disconnected from the player's presence and influence. He can react to it, but he cannot (in many cases) force an event to occur earlier or later nor prevent it from occuring.

In one case the game scenario, the game world, the game's story can only progress as much as the player. In the other case the player can only progress as much as the game world and story.

Everything depends on conditions still, but conditions in which the player is only one of multiple factors among the other characters in the game which are driven by their own motives. Time, or evem weather or simple chance may be other possible factors at play.  

It is only in this sense, that "story-driven", as which we describe Phoenix, receives its true meaning. It does *not* mean, that the game is focused on the story, but it is a design approach to offer an experience that is opposed to a "player-driven" experience. "Story-driven" describes a game that is driven by the story and not by the player. 

The story is driven forward; the player influences the events, reacts to the events, initiates some events, but he cannot stop the drama. It is unfolding in front of the eyes of the player and the player is a part of it, thrown into it, but he is *not* in control. He is in control of his character only, of the little role that he plays. 

I will argue that this is a necessary aspect of immersive sim-rpg design if we want to follow it consequently and develop it further. Because if playing in a immersively simulated game world, this "simulation" is as non-immersive as it gets, when the story of the roleplay does not move forward in any way independent from the player. 

It was only in form of the collapse of the old mine and the attack on the free mine (which were supposed to be two different events originally, besides diverse other similar story twists) that in the release version something happened behind the back of the player - at every other point in the story we could say that the world of Gothic was completely static!  

By this particular story twist at least the illusion was conveyed that something has happened independently from the players actions (while actually it was triggered by nothing else than the player having a specific dialogue etc.) In Phoenix, these kinds of events happening "behind the back" of the player have to apply to almost everything and most often not in an illusionary way, but actually triggered by factors independent from the players influence, such as time. 

Whether or not he is witnessing them depends on whether or not he is at the right place at the right time. A factor which again is heavily influenced by which guild he belongs to and so on.

Being "story-driven" in this sense of the term is also a necessary consequence of the idea of a "realtime" rpg, as which Gothic has always been promoted.  
In a game where everything happens "in real time", but only if the player is ready for it to happen, realtime is a mere illusion; it is realtime only in a mechanical, gameplay related perspective as opposed to "round-based". But the story is *not* realtime. Instead of the story unfolding in "real" (play) time, it unfolds by the player "unlocking" every bit of story one single bit at a time at will. 

Neither the story nor we as the story-authors, nor the other characters nor the demonic threat lurking deep below do nor should care for the will and convenience of the player, nor do we ask the question, if it is convenient for him right now that an assassin is send against him or that the camp is being attacked and so on.
