*Can you get NPCs to join your quest and aid you in battle? If so, do you control them, or do they act independently?*
**Alex:** Yes, this will happen. They act independently so you can't make them do something completely silly.
**Mike:** A party member will not let you down in battle unless you decide to attack a 15 feet towering troll. Party members will react like you, so you can control them indirectly; i.e. you attack-they attack, you quit battle-they quit battle, you sneak-they sneak (if they're able to), etc. (3dgaming.net, 30.07.1999)
