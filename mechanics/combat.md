## Critique

*28.08.2024 - 28.09.2024*

At the beginning we will quote everything of relevance about what the fighting system was meant to be according to interviews and design doxumentation. Then we analyse how this compares to the actual implementation in the game. In the end we present our own solutions. 

> Alex: *Gothic is a real-time game. Combat will also be real-time, but for the biggest part it won't depend on your trigger finger if you succeed or fail in a fight. For example there will be no way for you to kill an enemy with a full plate armor and a battle-axe if you are bare-handed, except sneaking from behind and pushing him over the ledge. Fighting in Gothic will have strong tactical elements. Do I attack, step back, or parry the enemy's blow and start a counter-attack?*  
> *You can actually plan your next moves because our combat system doesn't rely on fast reflexes. If you want to be totally defensive, then you can keep your weapon up by pressing a key, and you will parry every blow that your opponent does. You just have to take into consideration that if the attacking force is much stronger than you - you can't parry a two-handed weapon with a dagger - you will be pushed back or even can fall to the ground. If you're more into fighting from a distance, you could use bows or crossbows. Depending on your talent, you will be able to aim at fast moving targets or you can try to do a critical hit by aiming at your enemy longer.* - [rpgvault.ign.com 06/1999](https://gothicarchive.org/interviews/1999/29.06.1999_rpgvault.ign.com.txt)
