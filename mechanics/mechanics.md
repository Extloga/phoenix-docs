In this section of the concept we will deal with how to translate the *vision* into gameplay; how the player can play and how to design the underlying systems enabling this play. We will summarise and explain the possibilities of interaction between the player and his character, between the player character and other characters and between characters and the game world.  
Classes, Attributes, Skills, modes of interaction, experience, attitudes, interface, character progression and so on. The mechanics are the technical frame and the "rules" of the game within which the story takes place. 


## Gameplay Principles

* A story-driven game is not a film with passages of interactivity, but a simulated story in a simulated world with simulated A-life the player can constantly interact and interfere with. And with "Interaction consistency": What NPCs can do, the PC (player character) can do and vice versa. What is not interactive is not played. The more a game is playable the more game it is, the more it utilises the potential of a videogame as a medium. And in consequence of a believable simulated stage of this gothic drama Phoenix has to be, the world and story should evolve on its own, if the player interferes with it or not.
* In that Phoenix is story driven, it is of course pre-narrated to a high degree, but not in a linear way, but in what we may call a multi-dynamic-simultaneous narrative. It is (1) "multi" because he can choose several pre-narrated paths with a few different branchings during gameplay. It is (2) "dynamic" because the world and the other characters do not wait for the player. The story progresses (in parts) independent from the player's actions. The game may even end and the player is too late. It is (3) "simultaneous" in that NPCs play a role that the player may have played under other circumstances; since the world and story are simulated in real time he cannot be at two locations at once, he will necessarily be at point X while something happens at point Y. Example: Since he cannot be in two guilds at once, an NPC will receive the very mission that the player would otherwise receive if playing for that faction or guild and may then be confronted with this character and his endeavours from another perspective.
