In this section of the concept we will deal with how to translate the *vision* into gameplay; how the player can play and how to design the underlying systems enabling this play. We will summarise and explain the possibilities of interaction between the player and his character, between the player character and other characters and between characters and the game world.  
Classes, Attributes, Skills, modes of interaction, experience, attitudes, interface, character progression and so on. The mechanics are the technical frame and the "rules" of the game within which the story takes place. 


## Gameplay Principles

Todo: Put to story, at least point 2 and 3.  

* A story-driven game is not a film with passages of interactivity, but a simulated story in a simulated world with simulated A-life the player can constantly interact and interfere with. And with "Interaction consistency": What NPCs can do, the PC (player character) can do and vice versa. What is not interactive is not played. The more a game is playable the more game it is, the more it utilises the potential of a videogame as a medium. And in consequence of a believable simulated stage of this gothic drama Phoenix has to be, the world and story should evolve on its own, if the player interferes with it or not.
* In that Phoenix is story driven, it is of course pre-narrated to a high degree, but not in a linear way, but in what we may call a multi-dynamic-simultaneous narrative. It is (1) "multi" because he can choose several pre-narrated paths with a few different branchings during gameplay. It is (2) "dynamic" because the world and the other characters do not wait for the player. The story progresses (in parts) independent from the player's actions. The game may even end and the player is too late. It is (3) "simultaneous" in that NPCs play a role that the player may have played under other circumstances; since the world and story are simulated in real time he cannot be at two locations at once, he will necessarily be at point X while something happens at point Y. Example: Since he cannot be in two guilds at once, an NPC will receive the very mission that the player would otherwise receive if playing for that faction or guild and may then be confronted with this character and his endeavours from another perspective.

* Two diametrically opposed approaches: (1) The game scenario, the game world, the game's story can only progress as much as the player. (2) The player can only progress as much as the game world and story.

* It is one approach, as used most often, including in Gothic itself, that the game world and story are waiting for the player to trigger specific conditions and thereby initiate events. While there is the possibility of a completely opposite approach: Events unfold on their own and are also, but not *only* driven by the actions of the player, which is only one small factor, but as well by actions of NPCs completely disconnected from the player's presence and influence. He can only react, but he cannot (in many cases) force an event to occur earlier or later nor prevent it from occuring.

Still everything depends on conditions, but conditions in which the player is only one of multiple factors: Other characters in the game, the time or even chance may be other factors at play.  

In this sense, "story-driven", as which we describe Phoenix, receives its true meaning. It does not only mean, that the game is focused on the story, but it is a design approach to offer an experience that is opposed to a "player-driven" experience. "Story-driven" describes a game that is driven by the story and not by the player. 

The story is driven forward; the player influences the events, reacts to the events, initiates some events, but he cannot stop the drama. It is unfolding in front of the eyes of the player and the player is a part of it, thrown into it, but he is *not* in control. 

I will argue that this is a necessary aspect of immersive sim-rpg design if we want to follow it consequently and develop it further. If playing in a immersively simulated game world, this "simulation" is as non-immersive as it gets, when the story of the roleplay does not move forward in any way independent from the player. 

It was only in form of the collapse of the old mine and the attack on the free mine (which were supposed to be two different events) that in the release version something happened behind the back of the player - at every other point in the story this world is completely static! And by this particular story twist at least the illusion is conveyed that something has happened independently from the players actions (while actually it was triggered by nothing else than the player having a specific dialogue etc.) In Phoenix, these kinds of events happening "behind the back" of the player have to apply to almost everything and most often not in an illusionary way, but actually triggered by factors independent from the players influence, such as time. And whether or not he is witnessing them depends on whether or not he is at the right place at the right time. A factor which again is heavily influenced by which guild he belongs to etc.

It is also a necessary consequence of the idea of a "realtime" rpg, as which Gothic has always been promoted. In a game where everything happens "in real time", but only if the player is ready for it to happen, realtime is a mere illusion; it is realtime only in a mechanical, gameplay related perspective as opposed to "round-based". But the story is *not* realtime. Instead of the story unfolding in "real" (play) time, it unfolds by the player "unlocking" every bit of story one single bit at a time.
