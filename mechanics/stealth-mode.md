# Stealth Mode

[Do we need a new "hidden" attribute of Visbility? Or Hiding?]

Thief Mechanics to realise the stealth system as summarised in the CLASSES document:

**Light:** We need a perception of light and darkness that npcs can react to and that the player can clearly understand. We have to check for lightsources and the range of the corresponding lightvobs to calculate the players visibility, that we then visualise for the player in form of a visibility-bar that shows how hidden/visible he is. And we have to enable the player to destroy lightsources (distinguish fire etc.) in order to decrease his visibility.

**Sound:** We have to modify the sound in stealth mode during run-time: The footsteps, causing different sound effects depending on the material walked upon, have to become louder, while the music and other sound effects, inspite of nearby npcs, have to become quieter, to show the selective perception of the thief and to represent his focus on the noise that he makes and tries to diminish. For the thief to deal with enemies, he has to be able to distract them (by throwing objects, making sounds) and to get rid of them in silent ways: Knock-out, strangle and/or backstabbing, as well as dragging or carrying their bodies to hide them. 

**Smell:** Not just for animals it is feasable to include smell as an additional sense which the thief can interfere with to deal with enemies. He will be able to distract animals via smell with food that they find to lure them away or into a trap. He can use the same mechanics to slowly tame animals if he learned that skill (not exclusive for thieves). But he also can set something aflame to let someone sense the smell of burning, or he can place something rotten (think of a dead rat) nearby to distract a guard. 


## Thief Skills

In the Alpha there were about nine skills specifically planned for the Thief:
(1) Sneaking
(2) Hiding in Shadows
(3) Lockpicking (I-III)
(4) Pickpocketing (I-III)
(5) Sixth/Seventh Sense
(6) Acrobatics [+ II-III]
(7) Dirty Daggertricks (I-III)
(8) Dark Sense (Nightsight) and 
(9) Assassination. 

Other than, for instance, sneaking around, opening closed doors and chests (picklock), stealing from a sleeping guard (pickpocket) and killing silently (assassination) with a dagger, all while having a heightened awareness (seventhsense/darksense), there is another important ability of the gothican Thief: His agility. He has to be more agile than any other class. He must reach windows, roofs, all kinds of places inaccessible to other classes. Thus, what I want for the thief class, is to link the cross-class climbing talent to the thief-exclusive acrobatics (lev 2-3) in order to enable him to become sort of a traceur (parcour). And when he is on the run, he has to be able to use his surroundings to his advantage, be it by destroying something and blocking the way for his persecutors, by hiding in a barrell etc.
