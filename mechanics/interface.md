Tom Putzki: Due to our optical feedback for the Player in all parts of the game 3rd person perspective is the best way to play GOTHIC.


Michael Hoge: An easy interface is one of the most important assumptions for good gameplay. You will only need 8 keys to control most of the game. (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Spacebar and the arrow keys)

Delekhan: You refer to "easy interface" and "easy to use controls", yet melee-type combat is somewhat more complex than the more commonly-used range-combat. How will you address this problem?

Alex Br√ºggemann: That's right. At the moment we're knee-deep in implementing and fine-tuning the melee-combat. Michael created a combat-system that's very different from the things you have seen in other games. I'd like to tell you some details but we want to be absolutely sure that it's fun to play before we talk about it in detail.

Tom Putzki: Let me tell you just this: testing the melee-combat-system with Michael really is dangerous for your health...

**Mike Hoge:** We chose the 3rd person view because close combat will be an essential part of the game.



Jonric: Please tell me about the interface. How do movement and inventory work? How will conversations and other interactions with NPCs take place?
Alex: OK, as I mentioned before the interface is very easy to use. The inventory, for example, has an auto-sort function so you won't have to sort your stuff by hand. I hope you'll like this feature as much as I do. Sorting things in real life isn't much fun - if you could see all the stuff on my desktop! - so why put it into a game? Oops, I forgot Tetris! Sorting things can be great fun, but not in inventories
We have a context sensitive help system - we'll still have to figure out a cool name for it. Movement works quite similar to other third-person games like Tomb Raider, but for interacting with other persons and objects we figured out a special interface that makes it very easy to interact with NPCs you can talk, steal, or give items to them by only pressing two keys. Because of our easy interface you don't need a combination of input devices. You can choose to play the game using keyboard or gamepad.

Jonric: What will make Gothic stand out from the other RPGs in development now? And to what kind of gamer will Gothic appeal most strongly?
Tom: The AI, the daily routines of the NPCs and the, what we call it, living world. The NPCs and monsters live their lives whether the player is there or not. The player has to get right with the world, and the NPCs are part of this world - and it's their world of course ;-)
Gothic will be a challenge for hard-core role playing gamers because of its game depth and its storyline. Due to the simple user interface, visualising everything and feedback for every thing you do, it will also be suitable for the mainstream player who is used to steering Lara through her world...
