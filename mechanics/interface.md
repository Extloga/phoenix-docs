Tom Putzki: Due to our optical feedback for the Player in all parts of the game 3rd person perspective is the best way to play GOTHIC.


Michael Hoge: An easy interface is one of the most important assumptions for good gameplay. You will only need 8 keys to control most of the game. (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Spacebar and the arrow keys)

Delekhan: You refer to "easy interface" and "easy to use controls", yet melee-type combat is somewhat more complex than the more commonly-used range-combat. How will you address this problem?

Alex Br√ºggemann: That's right. At the moment we're knee-deep in implementing and fine-tuning the melee-combat. Michael created a combat-system that's very different from the things you have seen in other games. I'd like to tell you some details but we want to be absolutely sure that it's fun to play before we talk about it in detail.

Tom Putzki: Let me tell you just this: testing the melee-combat-system with Michael really is dangerous for your health...

**Mike Hoge:** We chose the 3rd person view because close combat will be an essential part of the game.
