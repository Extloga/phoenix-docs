# (Non-)Hero

*Flosha*, 04.10.2024

I use the term "non-hero" here in difference to "anti-hero" as it is not about a different kind of hero, who has darker, different traits than how a hero is usually presented, but in the literal sense of *not* being *the* hero. 

At several occasions we will try to express doubt about this assumption in the story. The player may assume to play the hero, the one who will change everything. But throughout the story and depending on specific decisions, he may become aware that his role is far less important than he thought or may want to be. He is not alone in the world. Everyone plays a role and influences the whole. 

Nonetheless and at the same time we will also try to make clear, that everyone indeed can become a hero if he chooses to, if he decides to *act*. The smallest, unimposing individual may be able to make a difference and influence others, alone and against the odds, or with and through the support of friends. But he may also fail. He may live his life or his life may live him. He may savor death or death may devour him. He may wait too long for nothing or live *now*. 

We make a roleplaying (anti-)game and failure is part of the game logic. You will never be happy with a playthrough as it will never all go as you wish; or you may well be, when you are ready to face every encounter as it comes and to live with the consequences of your choices and accidents, when you give up your expectations and desires and give an answer that the moment demands. This project is meant to be dialogic, radical, philosophical, strange, maybe therapeutic to some degree, but it is not at all meant to please you. 

Relevant dialogue snippets:

*in the mine...*
> Who do you think you are? Who has told you that *you* are the hero? Know your place or get lost!

*some random question*
> Do you think everything depends on you? 

* a mission missed due to time*
> Where the fuck have you been?! 
> I... 
> Did you think we will wait for you? Do you think THEY will wait for you? We had a job to do! Now it's done and you were NOT here. 
> Every death of our men that were killed today is your fault! Gomez will get to know about this, you can bet on that.. 

*the player critizised for his acts*
> You keep acting as if you are alone in this world. And as if everything depends on you. No! YOU depend on everything. We do not need you. YOU need us. You better realise this.

We not only use fourth-wall-breaking hints like these, we also try to raise the question whether the player is the actual main character of the story. It should be difficult to know who is the main character, or rather: It should be a valid option to think that there is none. 

If there is someone who plays a more important role than others, then it's those with the most power in the prison hierarchy. Xardas and the mages, Gomez and the Barons, Y'Berion and the Gurus, Lee and his men, they have the most power, they influence the events, they make decisions and let others act upon them. The player is inside this hierarchy and should feel accordingly.

But we will also convey the opposite idea. We will both try to humble the one who thinks he is alone in the world and that this world is there for him (as so many in reality), as well as uplift the one who may feel as if he is completely unimportant and with no influence whatsoever (as so many in reality). For him it may turn out that he can indeed be of importance, because of the decisions he made and followed through. 

Which of the two the player belongs to and in how far, depends on his roleplay and how he "writes" his character (via dialogue decisions and maybe via influencing the diary too). This way he develops a different character, shapes his role; in the same way as he develops different attitudes towards factions, ideas, the prophecies, to the question of free will, to freedom and so on.

Xardas in the role of the "puppeteer" is another aspect of relevance here, as he lets others do as he wishes (or tries to do that), including the player character(s). 

The player may or may not become aware of this, may or may not cooperate with him, may or may not share his vision and approach. He may willingly follow his advise or turn to others. 

One may see in him the only one who knows what is going on in this world, making following him an almost inevitable congruity; another may feel to be led astray and try to "cut the strings" to get rid of his influence. It all depends on the player. 

Or it may not. Because there is also the even greater puppeteer, the one who wrote the story, the one who gives the player the ability to choose, who sets him limits to what he can choose, what he can do and say. What is his role in the story? And in how far can one liberate oneself from him? In how far one can liberate oneself from us, the story-writers? And will we try to capture the player? Or will we let him go, let go of him? What is freedom in this regard? 

The question is: Will he let go of the prison he let us trap him in or in which he trapped himself in? Will he get lost in it or will he find more in it than a game stealing some time of his life? Because if he doesn't, the project will have failed, at least in this regard.  

The philosophical reflections inside of the game transcend themselves, in that they reflect beyond the game about the one behind the screen, hero or not.
