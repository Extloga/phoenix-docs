# Writing the Player Character

Mike and PB have chosen a simple and pragmatical solution to create a player character that everyone (or many) can easily identify with, in that they made him a nobody and do not let him talk much. He talks and expresses so little of actual meaning or personality, that he keeps being like a canvas that every player can project his own thoughts on, but cannot express them. 

The player can have his own attitude because the player character seems to have none. And he has none because the player character is basically only there to serve his function as the hero of the story. He is there for the story to work. But because the player can not express his attitude in the game, the attitude can not become a factor in the story. He can project his attitude on the player character, but he is not able at all to carry his attitude into the game world through the player character. 

In Gothic the story is there for the player, the player is needed for the story. And the player character is his medium of interaction, as some sort of the least common demoninator. Really the least? No, because: Would he be, it would have been more consequent to let him be completely silent. He would have been someone like Gordon Freeman or the guy in System Shock. 

But this wouldn't have been in accordance with Gothics approach to immersion. He has to talk, he has to have a voice. After all, this is a roleplaying game. 

In Phoenix, which is story-driven, the function of the player character is different. The story is there for itself and the player is not needed. The story is told if he listens to it or not and if he influences it or not. But he wants to listen and wants to influence events; here is the difference and we have to enable him to do that in a believable way.  


## Storyinteraction vs. Roleplaying

One way is a solution like in the Witcher, where the character *has* a strong personality and opinions and the player has only one role to choose: his. But is this roleplaying? 

How can it be roleplaying, if you have no influence on the role that you play? For it to be roleplaying you either have to be able to choose one of several roles, then play it accordingly (as in the old, traditional rpgs) and/or you have to be able to play a character which role you can influence and choose in course of the game (which Gothic/Phoenix ought to be). If you just play with one character with one fixed role, then there is no roleplaying here. Otherwise every simple shooter would be a RPG.

In some so-called rpgs you have lots of decisions to make. Decisions such as how you skill. But these are tactical decisions, its like: "Which weapon do I choose?" in a shooter. That is not what makes an rpg.  
You can also make a lot of decisions in the story within dialogues, but these dialogues do not seem to influence your character, how he relates to the world or how he sees himself, they only influence specific consequences in the story, the outcome of missions, at most his attitude towards one of two factions etc. This, for me, is not at the core of roleplaying either; it is interactive story-playing, not interactive role-playing. 

Gothic went a different way, in that it gives the player a character that almost remains free of personality in order to let the player project their own ideas unto him. But where is the roleplaying in that?  

Why instead do we not give the player the ability (through decisions in dialogues) to form attitudes and personality, to express actual thoughts, so that he can shape his character to his own preferences and inclinations? 

Just as a dialogue decision, when being made, influences e.g. the choice of a guild and thus restricts other options that he would otherwise have, in the very same way we can have personality-forming or attitude-forming dialogue decisions that, when being made, are shaping the character into a specific direction, open up different future dialogue options and exclude others. 

The player should not just be able to influence specific aspects of a mission through his reaction, he should be able to influence his character, his role itself, by different reactions in regard to his attitude about a matter, what he thinks, what he prefers, how he positions himself. 

Other characters may ask him simple questions: What do you think? Are you for this or for that? Do you prefer this or that? And these decisions will have influence on the direction that his role will develop into. That is what I see comes much closer to the core of roleplaying, because it actually relates to the role, it plays with the role. 

Tldr: Roleplaying is not identical with interactive storyplaying. For actual "roleplaying" to happen one must be able to either choose different characters as representatives of specific roles one can play (classical rpgs) or one must be able to play one specicic character with which he can choose different roles by character forming decisions during gameplay. And it is not enough to play as a different class or for a different guild to have a different "role", it must go along different opinions and positions; it is about how one relates to the class, the guild he has chosen, how he relates to the events in the game world and in the story.
