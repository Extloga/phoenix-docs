*I know you've put a lot of work into your camera system, so please tell me about it.*
**Carsten:** We use a third-person perspective in Gothic. The camera is responsible for making the player see what he really wants, like enemies trying to attack him, items he wants to pick up or a monster in an abyss below while throwing a huge stone on his head. To achieve this, the camera system uses different angles and motion types, depending on the game situation, thus being more sophisticated than first-person cams or simple third-person cams which always tend to look at the player's back.

*Can you tell us about the camera angles? Will you be able to set your own camera angles, or is it set automatically?*
**Carsten Edenfeld:** There will be no need to exclusively set the camera angles as the AI will self-decide which angles and movement mode is best for a given game situation. For example, the fight camera will behave differently than the normal behind-the-player-cam in order to include most points of interest for the player. This can be useful, as for example when a monster tries to knock you down from behind, and you are exploring some other things in front of you, the camera will react accordingly and focus on those things, you really want to see.
