# Focus

*Flosha, 28.09.2024*

The focus is an idea for a sort of n internal attribute which unlocks "special" abilities. Every class has its own "focus" equivalent. 

***Warriors*** have a focus which serves primarily as the requirement for special attacks. The focus has to be filled by fluid combat and parades or evasions without being hit and enables the player to initiate special attacks in form of "combos", as one would do in *Pro Skater* or traditional Fighting Games, potentially be combined by short windows of slow motion, representing the increased concentration and awareness of the warrior, to enable him to use the correct moment to initiate the desired attack. 

So in this way the focus would be filled via combat flow, but not depleted by an actual special attack; like in Pro Skater a successful special attack will keep the focus bar filled. it is only depleted by being hit without succesfully parading, - in which case it is fully depleted immediately - or by interruption of the combat flow, that means: If not having enemy contact for ~2-3 sec it begins to deplete in the duration of ~3-5 sec. And then it is depleted by using slow motion. 

Slow motion doesn't have to be used, but it makes it easier doing combos and getting special attacks. But since slow motion depletes the focus bar, only one special attack can be done this way, after which the bar needs to be filled again by regular combat flow. While those players who have mastered the combat system better can land successful combos without using slow motion, thereby keeping the focus bar filled and being able to move much more fluently with one combo after another. 

***Thieves** have a focus which serves primarily to heighten their awareness and concentration in stealth. While the focus of warriors is filled by combat flow, the focus of thieves is filled by danger, pressure, the raised probability to be caught. The closer the player is to a guard, the more his focus will fill, like adrenaline that enables him to do extraordinary efforts. It will also fill the more alert the guards or monsters are. E.g. if they know that someone is there and seek him and going into his direction, actively looking for him, that will slowly fill his bar. 



So if the focus bar is activated,
