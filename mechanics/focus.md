# Focus

*Flosha, 28.09.2024*

The focus is an idea for a sort of an internal attribute which unlocks "special" abilities. Every class has its own version of "focus". 

***Warriors*** have a focus which serves primarily as the requirement for special attacks. The focus has to be filled by combat "flow" in form of attacks, parades and/or evasions without being hit and enables the player to initiate special attacks in form of "combos", in the same way as done in traditional fighting games or like Special Tricks in the *Pro Skater* series. But it also can be used to activate short windows of slow motion, representing the increased concentration and awareness of the warrior, to enable him to use the correct moment to initiate the desired attack. 

So in this way the focus would be filled via combat flow, but not depleted by a special attack; like in Pro Skater a successful special attack will keep the focus bar filled. it is only depleted by being hit without succesfully parading, - in which case it is fully depleted immediately - or by interruption of the combat flow, that means: If not having enemy contact for ~2-3 sec it begins to deplete in ~3-5 sec. And finally it is depleted by using slow motion. 

Slow motion doesn't have to be used, but it makes it easier doing combos and getting special attacks. But since slow motion depletes the focus bar, only one special attack can be done this way, after which the bar needs to be filled again in the combat flow. While those players who have mastered the combat system better can land successful combos without using slow motion, thereby keeping the focus bar filled and being able to move much more fluently with one combo after another. This way they can, for instance, keep the bar filled and preserve the slow motion for a final deadly special attack at the end of the fight. By designing the system like this, we solve the issue of slow motion as an annoying mechanic while preserving it as a means dramatic and stylsed effect. We do not annoy the player with undesired and randomly appearing slow motion that may rather destroy than serve the flow nor do we force him to use it for special attacks, but give him the control to do so in accordance with his own desired expression of dramatical intensity. 

Thus the "style" of combat becomes interactive, a process of "styling" and intensifying a combat encounter at will and at any given moment, since the player can choose to slow a motion down at any given time and for the desired duration as long as his focus is full. 

***Thieves** have a focus which serves primarily to heighten their awareness and concentration in stealth. While the focus of warriors is filled by combat flow, the focus of thieves is filled by danger, pressure, by a raised probability to be caught. The closer the player is to a guard, the more his focus will fill. It will also fill the more alert the guards or monsters of an area are. E.g. if they know that someone is there, going into his direction, actively looking for him, that will fill his bar. The closer a guard comes to the player or the closer the player sneaks up to a guard, the fastee the focus will fill, like adrenaline that pushes him to extraordinary efforts.
