**Mike:** You are in some underground caves. You face death itself in the form of 3 Goblins. Wait! Gobbos are about 3 feet high. They're no real threat - and they know it! So they cautiously approach you, and one of them tries to get behind you. You draw your sword (which you've most recently taken from the sucker who didn't want to let you over the bridge), eager to test its abilities on some gobbos. One gobbo jumps forward. Your blade hits him in mid-air, his body lifelessly drops before you, and he loses his weapon out of his hand. The remaining gobbos flee in panic around the next corner. **You leave the sword behind, because almost everyone on the surface has a better one, and they won't buy crap!** (3dgaming.net, 30.07.1999)
