Delekhan: How will health regeneration work? Will there be a need for sleeping or feeding?

Alex Br√ºggemann: No need for sleeping in our game. Although this may not be realistic, it's much more fun. Only the NPCs have to sleep sometimes and this is your chance to do all the things you can't do while they're awake. Eating gives you a health bonus, but you don't have to eat to stay healthy.

Tom Putzki: This is a fantasy game in a fantasy world - who wants to be realistic?
