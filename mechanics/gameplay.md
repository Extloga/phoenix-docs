### The Forces of Fate

Condemned and banished into a strange world, the road ahead is yours to choose. Pick one of eight guilds in three different camps, make friends and enemies, learn to fight with a double-bladed axe or choose the fine art of magic and sorcery instead. Learn to move about without making a sound or practise hitting the bulls-eye from 100 feet. Whichever path you choose, your abilities shall determine what adventures you encounter and what challenges you must face up to. Last but not least, your behaviour will decide whether that path will be a long one - or whether you shall end your days being devoured by meat-bugs ...    
"Well, no-one said it would be easy." *Alex Brüggemann, demon conjurer*


### You see what you get

No endless tables and charts, no need to calculate talents and abilities: no numerical chaos.
Whatever your character learns will be visibly represented. You'll see what we mean once you've had your first heavy training ... moves that look more fascinating will be more powerful than others. "(...) We consider it very important that in GOTHIC players get an optical feedback for everything they do!" *Tom Putzki, pastime mercenary*


### The Convicts

"(...) What you do does matter, it makes a huge difference ..."  
*Stefan Nyul, ore baron*

"Hey Kid, get me the goblet of Gomez, the leader of the ore barons. If you succeed, you may be of some use to us!"  
This world is full of dangerous criminals. It's THEIR world, and all you are is a fresh chunk of meat. This means they won't just be hanging around all day waiting for you to come along and speak to them. On the contrary! Try persuading the angry chef – who, by the way, weighs one hundred and eighty pounds and simply can't stand you – that you're worthy of a meal ...  
They work in mines, sleep, stand on guard, make fun of new arrivals, test their abilities in brawls and duels and go hunting, all the while prepared to fight for their lives and the defense of their property. Over 200 characters are ready and waiting to either talk to you or bash your face in, depending on your actions. Never forget that they all have friends who are more than willing to defend them or their territory. Watch your step and when you've thought twice before stealing something from one of these people, think again – you don't even want to know what they're capable of doing to you! Worst of all, they all have an excellent memory! So be very careful who you steal from ...  
"Some people don't like others sticking their nose in where it doesn't belong." Shadow, Alberto's right-hand man


### The Beasts

You sneak along the edge of the abyss, feeling every tendon in your arms tensing, sweat running down your muscles. On the other side of the dark canyon a huge troll has reared up, a bundle of muscles twice the size of any human being, but not even he can cross the gap between you. You take aim carefully, the deadly arrow shoots from the string and a moment later the gigantic creature's agonized cry pervades you. You prepare the next arrow, the monster's red eyes seem to pierce you. Just as you have your arrow perfectly placed, he flings something at you with a powerful sweep of his mighty arms. You duck. You are about to turn back to face the monster when you hear the fearce growl of a Gobbo right beside you! Even as you draw your sword to deal with this fiend, the troll takes aim again ...  
Monsters can sense you approaching. Their behaviour varies whether they are hunting or fighting, weak creatures may join forces. One thing is for sure: they won't just sit around and wait for you to come along and kill them. They have a certain inbred pattern of behaviour.  
"(...)or just fiddle about with their feet." *Michael Hoge, Art Director*
