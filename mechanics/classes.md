The four classes correspond to four different playstyles by which the player can approach game situations and solve the game. They are not selected before gamestart but they are immersively choosen during gameplay via individual playstile and a sequence of ingame choices. 

The class is acquired by a joining a guild as the representative of a camp-specific class.
In the gameplay mechanics they are primary styles of interaction.

## Mage: The Arcane Way	14.02.2022

Skills:
Identify Magic / Detect Magic  (Orpheus Guild System V2, Battlemage/Healing Mage)

magical aura. Have a sense to detect magic in objects. And see them glowing more.. That would make a lot of sense. Then the mages would be able to help the diggers to find ore.. which they also need for their runes etc. They can find magical artifacts easier, they can feel the magical power emanating from some special amulet/ring and so forth; and its visualised in some way for the player


[to the implementation: skills doc concerning TAL_IDENTIFY or TAL_MAGIC or whatever:]
To not be too obtrusive, the magical glowing pfx effect could be used for this talent. It was used in G2 for all kinds of objects. But honestly: I don't like it, that some potion or a spell has this magical glow around it, why should it? I mean, the potion is closed, the magic is signed/spoken into the spell; its not as if any non-mage, when a spell is lying among a bunch of others papers, could distinguish it easily by the paper somehow having glitter all around it... So we can use this exclusively, for the visualisation of the mages skill to identify magic. :)



## Thief: The Way of the Nimble	14.02.2022

In order to turn the thief into a properly playable class, we have to reimagine the stealth system. Self-explanatory, our main inspiration for the thief class has to be the game of the same name: THIEF: The Dark Project (1998). It was THIEF that introduced light and sound as gameplay mechanics. GOTHIC introduced smell as a third sense (it was just hardly utilisied). Via the guild of the Shadows, originally being envisioned as spies who hide in plain sight, there comes another inspiration into play: HITMAN (2000). 

Thus, the thieves gameplay has to be focused on staying in the shadows, literally (THIEF) and metaphorically (HITMAN). As a thief he hides in the dark, as a spy he hides in the crowd; as an assassin he may choose either way; and we have to give him the abilities to do so. 

The thieves game is a play with light, sound and smell. He will sneak in the dark, climb upon the roofs, break into the buildings, pick the locks, distract the guards and monsters, lure them into traps and disarm theirs; he will disguise himself as them to steal the objects or the infos of desire; and if he's caught he'll have to run like a traceur, into hiding again...
