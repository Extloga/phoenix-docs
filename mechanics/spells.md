Idea for a water spell:

* Water travel

The Watermage can form into and travel with water.
The spell can be used everywhere, where water is flowing.
In rivers, but also in small rivulets in dungeons, so that
by using the spell he could overcome and pass through specific
entrance paths that are unavailable to any other character.

In order to cast the spell, he has to stand deep enough in water.
When casted, he seems to "liquefy" and disappears.
The camera is now moving very fast alongside the river.
The player has to hit a button (just as with shapeshifting
to shift back) to stop the water travel upon which the mage
appears again. This way the mage can use the spell to 
fast travel by using the rivers.

If he does not hit any button, the camera just flies along
the flow of the rivers until it ends in the ocean, where
the mage automatically transforms back into solid form. 

--> This idea came to me when writing about the 
Phoenix Allegory and contemplating about the association therein
of the Waterpipe that provides the outer ring with water, with
the mages leaving the castle. If taken literally,
it would suggest that the mages actually left the castle
through this water pipe. And if they can transform into water,
this can be very well imagined.
