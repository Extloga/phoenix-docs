In this section of the concept we will deal with how to translate the *vision* into gameplay; how the player can play and how to design the underlying systems enabling this play, to bring our ideas into life through code.  

We will summarise and explain the possibilities of interaction between the player and his character, between the player character and other characters and between characters and the game world.  

Classes, Attributes, Skills, modes of interaction, experience, attitudes, interface, character progression and so on. The mechanics are the technical frame and the "rules" of the game within which the story takes place.
