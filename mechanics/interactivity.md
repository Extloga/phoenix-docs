Delekhan: Will you be using non-interactive "movies" anywhere in the game?

Tom Putzki: Absolutely no renderings. If you want to watch a movie, go to the cinema!

Michael Hoge: Yes, that's damn right. Every cutscene (made with the game-engine) in GOTHIC will be integrated in the game so that you can interact with the characters at any time.
