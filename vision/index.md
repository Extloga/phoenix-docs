# Vision

In the structure of our concept we started with the "vision". Here we deal with the original vision of the developers as well as the "myth" of a game as it formed in our minds inspired by what was promised and promoted before release. We show what this vision was made of, (re)define Gothic, deal with the decline of said vision and how it gave rise to the Phoenix project. We lay out principles of our artdesign to define our style - the "robe" of our vision - and describe our reconstructive approach.
