TODO: Write on the Gothic Development History and the Sequel etc.
Quote also from the GameStar interview



In the beginning there was an idea. 
Orpheus blabla.

Night (Nyx) is the beginning of all things.
This is the teaching of the Orphics.


Piranha Bytes was founded. And Orpheus was rescued.
It re-appeared like a Phoenix from the ashes.
Thus they have given it a new working title: "Phoenix".

Now they would make their own game in their own company.




## Origins of Piranha Bytes?

**Delekhan:** Can you tell us the origin of Piranha Bytes? Who are the key individuals involved in the creation of GOTHIC? Have we encountered your work elsewhere?

**Stefan Nyul:** [...] At Piranha Bytes there is just one key individual and that's the team. Everybody's work for GOTHIC is vital and so it would be unfair to elevate someone above the others.

**Mike Hoge:** Forget about all the stuff we did before. [...] I had to carry out other people's instructions and ideas if I were confident with them or not. Mostly, I wasn't. That's why I got started with Piranha Bytes.

**Tom Putzki:**  We founded Piranha Bytes because we wanted to produce games we want to play ourselves - that's what we want to achieve with Gothic.

**Mike:** It was always my dream to make computer games. I was always annoyed about the masses of bad games and thought: That must be done better! Now I know how much work it is if you try to realise high expectations - but it looks like we're going to make it! Everything will be fine! (PC Action, 10.08.1998)

**Stefan:** [...] Back then, we have worked on various games for the German market. But we urged for more and so we founded PIRANHA BYTES. With this splendid team we are sailing into international waters and we really have a "heavy load" with us :-) (gagames.com 20.06.1998)


-> reality


## Vision vs. Realisation

* The Game was supposed to XY (based on the research in Gothic Vision/Aesthetics/Gameplay -> then concluding what of it was achieved and what not (+ speculation why etc.)

zoks.de 04/2000
Die Gesamtgesellschaft in Gothic soll über eine Art Sozialsytem verfügen, ich vermute dahinter allerdings mehr PR-Strategie als umgesetzte Programmierung. Aber auch hier gilt: erst testen, dann meckern. Einfache Rückwirkungen auf die Gesellschaft führte bereits "Baldur's Gate", "Planescape Torment" entwickelte das Konzept logisch weiter, ob "Gothic" da anknüpfen kann, werden wir sehen.






**Flosha:** What do you think about our project?
**Tom:** You are mad, but in the most positive sense.

To use an allegory: The gothic Sleeper did awaken, but the gothic Phoenix did not rise. Gothic was revolutionary in its conception. It was still impressive in its released form and gained itself many followers, but it did not deliver what the conception promised. We see GOTHIC more than anything else as a proof of concept of what it could have been and we make Phoenix in a mad attempt to let it be. 

We are inspired by the vision as it was presented from 1998 to 2000 by the four founders of the old Piranha Bytes, that we have preserved in our Gothic Archive. 

We do not attempt to reconstruct one specific alpha version or to shape the game according to the ideas of one specific founder. They had contradictory ideas, shaping the final product into a mere fragment of their original vision and culminating in a conflict about a worthy successor, that led to the cancellation of the first, forgotten Gothic Sequel.

What we attempt to achieve is to unite the different ideas from all periods of development. We want to realise this diverse dream, as we imagined the game to be by the words written and images shown to us before release, to reconstruct and turn it into one harmonious and coherent whole and to go beyond in that we try to max out the radical potential of GOTHIC, as we dream beyond industrial constraints.

PHOENIX is what GOTHIC should have been. 

We try to realise the contradictory ideas of the founders, bring them to an end, and maybe thereby help, at least a bit, to heal the old wounds of their clash of dreams.






Maybe put into "A Clash of Dreams":

While Mike can be seen as the father of Gothic and the designer behind the basic framework of the story and the factions, it is very important to understand, that all of the details about them has been developed in course of at least two years of a constant exchange of ideas between the four founders, Mike Hoge, Stefan Nyul, Alex Brüggemann and Tom Putzki. They developed this vision together. 

And while Alex Brüggemann was more involved in the design of the game mechanics and Tom Putzki, - after first being responsible for the level design - focused on the marketing of their vision, Stefan Nyul was the man that was responsible for the majority of the story for the longest time in development, the main story writer. Mike was mainly responsible for the first chapter and then again wrote a lot in the last few months of development, when everything was changed, the old story removed and rewritten to meet the deadlines. 

I dare to argue, inspite of my love and affection for Mike and an understanding for all the decisions he made (I want to emphasize this), that in course of these years of development, Stefan Nyul may have had, at least in *some* regards, a better grasp of the background story than Mike had at the time, simply because he was involved in this story, especially the old story, more deeply. Mike is an exceptional visionary and artdirector, but Nyul was a great writer. 

And it is very striking and stands out a lot, how in his approach to a successor (he was the leader behind the Sequel project), he picked up so many loose story threads in the writing; the major story events that couldn't be realised in the first instalment (the Orc Assault and Nemesis), he still decided to mention in the Sequel, he still considered as a part of the lore; he just explained them to have been taken place between the events of Gothic and the Sequel, thereby tying back to all the work that had been done by the story-writers for years.

He did a great job - and this is said just from a very early, completely unfinished build of the project - to continue where they stopped and was motivated to do so. While the official successor as it came to being, that was then developed instead after the Sequel team had gotten fired, did not care about any of these old story ideas, that several story authors had developed for Gothic, at all. It has thrown all of it out and didn't even care to tie back to the release story much, leaving open many questions and ideas that have been hinted at in the first part and instead confronting the players with an almost completely different universe. By paying very little respect to the passionate work that went into the creation of the original story and setting, the official successor clearly steered Gothic away from its roots.

Phoenix is going back to the roots.
