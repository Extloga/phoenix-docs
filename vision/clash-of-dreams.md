# Clash of Dreams

<span class="changed">[WORK IN PROGRESS!]</span>

TODO: Write on the Gothic Development History and the Sequel etc.
Quote also from the GameStar interview




## Vision vs. Realisation

* The Game was supposed to XY (based on the research in Gothic Vision/Aesthetics/Gameplay -> then concluding what of it was achieved and what not (+ speculation why etc.)

Die Gesamtgesellschaft in Gothic soll über eine Art Sozialsytem verfügen, ich vermute dahinter allerdings mehr PR-Strategie als umgesetzte Programmierung. Aber auch hier gilt: erst testen, dann meckern. Einfache Rückwirkungen auf die Gesellschaft führte bereits "Baldur's Gate", "Planescape Torment" entwickelte das Konzept logisch weiter, ob "Gothic" da anknüpfen kann, werden wir sehen.






**Flosha:** What do you think about our project?
**Tom:** You are mad, but in the most positive sense.

To use an allegory: The gothic Sleeper did awaken, but the gothic Phoenix did not rise. Gothic was revolutionary in its conception. It was still impressive in its released form and gained itself many followers, but it did not deliver what the conception promised. We see GOTHIC more than anything else as a proof of concept of what it could have been and we make Phoenix in a mad attempt to let it be. 

We are inspired by the vision as it was presented from 1998 to 2000 by the four founders of the old Piranha Bytes, that we have preserved in our Gothic Archive. 

We do not attempt to reconstruct one specific alpha version or to shape the game according to the ideas of one specific founder. They had contradictory ideas, shaping the final product into a mere fragment of their original vision and culminating in a conflict about a worthy successor, that led to the cancellation of the first, forgotten Gothic Sequel.

What we attempt to achieve is to unite the different ideas from all periods of development. We want to realise this diverse dream, as we imagined the game to be by the words written and images shown to us before release, to reconstruct and turn it into one harmonious and coherent whole and to go beyond in that we try to max out the radical potential of GOTHIC, as we dream beyond industrial constraints.

PHOENIX is what GOTHIC should have been. 
PHOENIX is to GOTHIC what Oblivion Lost is to STALKER.

We try to realise the contradictory ideas of the founders, bring them to an end, and maybe thereby help, at least a bit, to heal the old wounds of their clash of dreams.
