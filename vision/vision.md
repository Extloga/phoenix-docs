# Vision

We started with the "vision", the most general and philosophical part of our concept, where we deal with the original vision of the developers as well as the "myth" of a game that formed in our minds inspired by what was promised and promoted before release. Here we show what this vision was made of, (re)define Gothic, deal with the decline of said vision and how it gave rise to the Phoenix project. We lay out principles of artdesign to define our style, the "robe" of our vision and we describe our reconstructive approach.
