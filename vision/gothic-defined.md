In order to create a gothic drama we have to define what "Gothic" is. Contrary to popular belief Gothic is not a mere game and its underlying concept, it is (or to be more precise "it was once supposed to be" and is to us) more than that: It was an attempt to initiate a genre of gothic-like games and to revolutionise the world of fantasy rpgs.

## Gothic vs. Common Fantasy

Gothic is supposed to be "another kind of fantasy". 

> Common Fantasy is very simple (...) divided into black & white, good & evil. Fantasy is neat, clean and colourful. GOTHIC is different. GOTHIC is gloomy. GOTHIC is dark. GOTHIC is mystical. GOTHIC is strange. GOTHIC is dangerous. GOTHIC is not a 3D-realtime-Fantasy-RPG. It's a 3D-realtime-GOTHIC-RPG. [Promotion booklet]

Isn't what was critisized here as "common fantasy" usually refered to as "high fantasy" today? And if so, isn't the description of Gothic as another kind of fantasy fitting to what is now commonly refered to as "dark" and/or "low" fantasy?  

Gothic *is* dark fantasy, which hints at its horror elements and its characteristics of being "dark", "gloomy" and "dangerous", but not every dark fantasy work is "gothic". Some authors may use the terms "dark fantasy" and "gothic fantasy" or "gothic fiction" interchangeably, but it being "dark" doesn't suffice to make it "gothic". Gothic fiction has some essential characteristics that are not to be found in most mere "dark fantasy" fiction. Gothic fiction is by definition romantic (in the traditional sense) and one of its core features is "the intrusion of the past upon the present", "the present being hunted by the past". Gothic is not gothic without this threatening past as a crucial element both for atmosphere (how the game world is presented where time has taken its toll on everything) as well as for the story (e.g. how the past of characters is hunting them, how the consequences of the war hunt the present kingdomn, how ancient rituals and prophecies play a role in the tragedy of today).    

In the same way Gothic is also low fantasy, ....  

To summarise: Gothic is both dark and low fantasy, but as a genre it is not equivalent to either; while it shares many of their characteristics it also includes the traditional elements of gothic fiction. 

And as we're dealing with a CRPG we have to understand how the characteristics of Gothic fiction may translate to gamedesign and which other principles were set in order to define "Gothic" as a genre of gothic-like videogames.


### Gothic Horror vs. Cosmic Horror





## Gothic-like Gameplay

In order to do that we have to consider what the four visionaries of GOTHIC (Mike Hoge, Alex BrÃ¼ggemann, Stefan Nyul and Tom Putzki) themselves said about their game, especially during the concept phase and in early development. How did they promote it, how did they speak about it, what did they consider most important about GOTHIC? 


### Analysing the Phoenix Pitch

At the time before GOTHIC was named GOTHIC it was promoted under its second working title Phoenix. The Phoenix Pitch may be the earliest document from that time that summarises the project as a whole. The cover shows the title and describes Phoenix as "the 3D Realtime RPG". Page 1 summarises the story, which shows it to be a story-driven game, the story is placed first. Page 2 gives a project overview, mostly dealing with numbers; amount of characters, levels, monsters, release date and so on. It describes its genre as a "Mix of fantasy role playing and action game" and to be primarily targeted at "mainstream players that like 3D world exploration / action / RPG". But the next pages actually deal with defining the gameplay and highlighting its most important characteristics.

> Phoenix is for those users who are fed up with mere 3d-killing and are longing for some deeper form of Entertainment. Phoenix is no typical role playing game. We've eliminated the disturbing, old-fashioned elements of RPG's, such as long player statistics and difficult handling and only kept the fun factors (...). Almost everything will be visualised in your viewport. (...) Due to the game's clear structure, there is no need for a complicated interface. (...) The challenge should not be to master the controls but to compete with the logic puzzles and monster tactics. The puzzles are based on consistent game physics. Every object can be manipulated (...)

Page 3 is completely focused on Phoenix' simplification of the complexity of common roleplaying games and how they want to achieve that by basically two principles: Radical Visualisation of (almost) everything and direct interaction with (almost) everything. 

Page 4 is titled "The world lives" and is completely focused on the aspect of a living game world. To quote the subtitles, it is dealing with how "there is a social structure", how "information is spreading" throughout the world, how "you will see them [NPCs and even Monsters] live their life", how "your foes will make a difference" and "the monsters will give it a second thought" (being about the enemies tactics and how sophisticated the artifical communication was supposed to become) and finally how "the world changes" in course of the story and how they're deliberately choosing a small world with lots of detail over a vast world that is empty or full of emtpy fillers. In short: It all deals with Phoenix being an elaborated immersive sim.






Phoenix was (and now is again) supposed to...

* be a mix of fantasy role playing and action (video) game in realtime 3D experienced in a 3rd person view (and other case-specific modes) with dynamic camera movement where the player is always in control of what he sees (no cutscenes, just an immersive simulated game world)
* not be a typical, "old-fashioned" role playing game, but should utilise the immersive potential of videogames as a medium in that it gets rid of statistics and unnecessary abstraction by radical visualisation and direct action, thereby revolutionising CRPGS
* be "a deeper form of Entertainment" that is "easy to understand but complex" in its possibilities of interaction, because you can interact with *everything* (items, objects, npcs (and in one of their next projects, Unplugged, they even wanted to add the base world itself to this list of interactivity by making the world destructible)), without a complicated interface "due to the game's clear structure"; it is made for those who like world exploration, action and RPGs (and in this order) with a gameplay that is not supposed to be a "Quake with swords" but tactical and focused on "monster-based puzzles" that have to be solved by direct interaction.
* 


 while the world is to be explored on a surface and a large (interconnected) underworld, both of which have to be gothic in style,
* have a gameplay that is focused


* challenging logic puzzles and monstar tactics


In this context we consider the oldest interviews to be by far the most interesting ones, because here they described their ideas most clearly and radically, when it was mostly still in their heads; when they wanted to do everything different and the game did not yet exist.

... include interviews ... pitch ... etc ...


Based on these descriptions we can deduce several characteristics of GOTHIC as "the other kind of fantasy" that define Gothic as a genre.

GOTHIC is...

[to be seen in opposition to common fantasy, as...]
* **amoral**, it is beyond good & evil and without a clear good/evil dichotomy
* **anarchic**, it is not neat, it is disordered and deals with chaos
* **dreary**, *not* colourful, it uses desaturated, washed out, faded colours
* **different**, it differs from what is commonly found in fantasy games

[dark and low fantasy combined, in that is is...]
* **gloomy** with a melancholic, depressing mood
* **dark** in its style, its setting, its story; aesthetically and thematically
* **mystical**, with mystic/occult aspects in a world where magic is special, not common
* **strange** in its setting, with unusual creatures and events to raise questions
* **dangerous** in its atmosphere and its design with both being coherent

[applying to gothic fiction/horror, in that it is...]
* **romantic** ...
* **melancholic** ... past/present
* **horrific**
