In order to create a gothic drama we have to define what "Gothic" is. Contrary to popular belief, Gothic is not a mere game and its underlying concept, it is (or rather was supposed to be) more than that: It was an attempt to initiate a genre of gothic-like games. GOTHIC is supposed to be "another kind of fantasy", as written in a promotion booklet: 

> Common Fantasy is very simple (...) divided into black & white, good & evil. Fantasy is neat, clean and colourful. GOTHIC is different. GOTHIC is gloomy. GOTHIC is dark. GOTHIC is mystical. GOTHIC is strange. GOTHIC is dangerous. GOTHIC is not a 3D-realtime-Fantasy-RPG. It's a 3D-realtime-GOTHIC-RPG.

Isn't what was critisized here as "common fantasy" usually refered to as "high fantasy" today? And if so, isn't the description of Gothic as another kind of fantasy fitting to what is now commonly refered to as "dark" and/or "low" fantasy?  

Gothic *is* dark fantasy, which hints at its horror elements and its characteristics of being "dark", "gloomy" and "dangerous", but not every dark fantasy work is "gothic". Some authors may use the terms "dark fantasy" and "gothic fantasy" or "gothic fiction" interchangeably, but it being "dark" doesn't suffice to make it "gothic". Gothic fiction has some essential characteristics that are not to be found in most mere "dark fantasy" fiction, films or games. Gothic fiction is by definition romantic (in the traditional sense) and one of its core features is "the intrusion of the past upon the present", "the present being hunted by the past". Gothic is not gothic without this threatening past as a crucial element both for the atmosphere (how the game world is presented, where the "teeth of time" nagt an everything) as well as for the story (like your own past hunting you, or the consequences of an ancient event hunting the present).   

In the same way, Gothic is also low fantasy, .... 

Thus "gothic" as a genre can not be seen as equivalent neither to dark fantasy nor low fantasy; while it shares many of their characteristics, it also includes the traditional elements of gothic fiction.  

But as we're dealing with a CRPG we have to consider how the characteristics of Gothic fiction translate to gamedesign, which will be crucial to define Gothic as a genre of gothic-like videogames.

In order to do that we have to consider what the four visionaries of GOTHIC (Mike Hoge, Alex Br√ºggemann, Stefan Nyul and Tom Putzki) themselves said about their game, especially during the concept phase and in early development.  
What did they consider most important about GOTHIC? How did they promote it in their pitch? How did they speak about it in Interviews?  

Regarding the original vision of the founders we consider the oldest interviews to be by far the most interesting ones, because here they described their ideas most clearly and radically, when it was mostly still in their heads; when they wanted to do everything different and the game did not yet exist.

... include interviews ... pitch ... etc ...


Based on these descriptions we can deduce several characteristics of GOTHIC as "the other kind of fantasy" that define GOTHIC as a genre.

GOTHIC is...

* **amoral**, it is beyond good & evil, without a clear good/evil dichotomy
* **anarchic**, it is not neat, it is disordered and deals with chaos
* **not colourful**, it comes with desaturated, washed out, faded colours
* **different**, it differs from what is commonly found in fantasy games
* **gloomy**, it has a melancholic, depressing mood
* **dark**, it is dark in its style, its setting, in its story
* **mystical**, it has mystic/occult elements; magic is special, not common
* **strange**, it is unusual with a unique setting that raises questions
* **dangerous**, it has a threatening atmosphere
