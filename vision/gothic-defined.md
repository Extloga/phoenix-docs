In order to create a gothic drama we have to define what "Gothic" is. Gothic is not just a specific game and its underlying concept, it was also an attempt to initiate a genre of gothic-like games. GOTHIC is supposed to be "another kind of fantasy", as written in a Gothic promotion booklet.  

> Common Fantasy is very simple (...) divided into black & white, good & evil. Fantasy is neat, clean and colourful. GOTHIC is different. GOTHIC is gloomy. GOTHIC is dark. GOTHIC is mystical. GOTHIC is strange. GOTHIC is dangerous. GOTHIC is not a 3D-realtime-Fantasy-RPG. It's a 3D-realtime-GOTHIC-RPG.

Based on these descriptions we can deduce several characteristics of GOTHIC as "the other kind of fantasy" that define GOTHIC as a genre.

GOTHIC is...

* **amoral**, it is beyond good & evil, without a clear good/evil dichotomy
* **anarchic**, it is not neat, it is disordered and deals with chaos
* **not colourful**, it comes with desaturated, washed out, faded colours
* **gloomy**, it has a melancholic, depressing mood
* **dark**, it is dark in its style, its setting, in its story
* **mystical**, it has mystic and occult elements, magic, cults, rituals etc.
* **strange**, it is unusual with an unique setting that raises questions
* **dangerous**, it has a threatening atmosphere

Regarding the early ideas of the four founders of Piranha Bytes (Mike Hoge, Alex Br√ºggemann, Stefan Nyul and Tom Putzki) we consider the oldest interviews to be by far the most interesting ones. Because here they described their ideas most clearly and radically, when it still was mostly in their heads, it was not yet a game and they wanted to do everything different.
