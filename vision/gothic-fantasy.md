Every fantastical story contains elements that are and were - as far as we know - not existent in our "real" world but can be *imagined* to have existed in the past or that could exist in the present or in the future. They both are *imaginative*, in opposition to "documentative" (like mere descriptions of events or observations, "real" stories) and in this sense, they are notional (or "fictitious") instead of historical (or "traditious"); they are "made up" instead of "handed down". 

In short: they are fantastical instead of realistical. But realistic here means only: "as it was realised in history" or "as it was realised in evolution" etc. But both historical as well as evolutionary developments could have turned out differently; it is in this sense that *some* fantastical stories or aspects of them can be considered conceivable as "potentially real", while others may hardly be able to be conceived - based on the world we know - as having any potential of realisation in the past, present or future.

And this is one of the crucial things to differentiate between fantastical stories (which contains "sci-fi" too). Instead of the very superficial and outdated differentiations such as fantasy vs. sci-fi, we differentiate different fantastical stories based on the following differentiations:

* Are they inspired or set in a historical period of the past, the present or in the future? (past/present/future)
* Are the fantastical elements of the story conceivable as *potentially* real?
  And does the story try to make this conceivability believable or doesn't it care for that? (../..)
* Are the fantastical or magical elements in "high" focus of (= especially highlighted in) the story or are they low-key? (high/low)
* Does the story have a dark, gloomy mood or a bright, colourful mood? (dark/bright)
* Is the story hard, cynical, brutal or rather soft, comforting and gentle? (hardboiled, roman/film/game noir)
* Does it comply to any specific writing/filming/gamedesign style? Such as: Gothic, 


* **Atmosphere and mood**: 
    * *World:* Is the world presented as dark and gloomy or as bright as colourful? (dark/bright)
    * *Story:* Is the story hard, cynical, brutal or rather soft, comforting and gentle? (hardboiled/film-noir/tragical vs. soft)
* **Visual and Narrative Style**:
* Does it comply to any specific writing/filming/gamedesign style? Such as: Gothic, 


* Nature of the Fantastical
