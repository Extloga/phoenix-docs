"shocklike"
"soulslike"
"roguelike"
"gothiclike"

Player "Diegesis", at the example of Half Life:
1. "First Person Perspective" [-> We'll argue against it]
2. "Silent Protagonist" [-> same]
3. "No Forced Actions" [including no cinematics; we follow that]
4. "Explained Mechanics" [logical link between player, mechanics and gameworld]


Diegesis Wikipedia:
Diegesis (/ˌdaɪəˈdʒiːsɪs/; from the Greek διήγησις from διηγεῖσθαι, "to narrate") is a style of fiction storytelling that presents an interior view of a world in which:

1. Details about the world itself and the experiences of its characters are revealed explicitly through narrative.
2. The story is told or recounted, as opposed to shown or enacted.[1]
3. There is a presumed detachment from the story of both the speaker and the audience.



Important:
Differentiate between the 
World/A-Life Simulation aspect -> Morrowind, Gothic, Stalker
and the Immersion aspect that comes down to
Simplification of the Interface
Visualisation of the Mechanics/Progression
and the Interactivity
