**Mike:** It's true the games are getting better - in ways of graphical presentation but NOT, in my humble opinion, in ways of gameplay or a good story. Almost every fantasy game released recently is merely hack and slay but has practically no story. It's like the heart of the game has been ripped out!  
We will combine both a (hopefully) <span class="demonic">genuine story</span> and an <span class="demonic">easy-to-use</span> gameplay with an engine which is at a clearly higher technical level than RPGs normally used to have. (IGN, 11.06.1998)

> The word is that even highly anticipated games like Ultima: Ascension look dull compared with GOTHIC's highly detailed and incredibly fast engine. And the game is already being touted by insiders for its breakthrough concepts. (MCV USA 01/1998)

**Torsten:** The idea of Gothic is rather a long sought for realisation of all the things that were always missing in games. Practically it is rather a necessity. (SOURCE?)

<!--**Torsten:** Die Idee zu Gothic ist eher eine langersehnte Umsetzung all der Dinge die immer in Spielen gefehlt haben. Praktisch also eher eine Notwenigkeit.-->


## Why is Gothic different?

**IGN:** What's special about Gothic? Why is it different?

**Stefan:** Gothic is a roleplaying game for everyone. It's so <span class="demonic">easy</span> to play the game, even my mother could do it, really. Gothic has the most intuitive and <span class="demonic">easiest</span> user interface ever encountered around roleplaying games having this much content. And everything that has impact on the game, fighting, spellcasting, character-improvement can be <span class="demonic">seen</span> in the gameworld rather than in dozens of menus or on character sheets with hundreds of numbers and tiny little bars. But under all this <span class="demonic">simplicity</span>, there stands a full roleplaying game and no simple 3D shooter with swords. (IGN, 11.06.1998)

**Mike:** The character development is based on <span class="demonic">visualization</span>. Every enhancement of your characters skills and attributes will be shown in graphical effects like changing character animations, there are no more character stats. (src??)


## Making of a fantasy RPG

**Delekhan:** Why did you decide to make a role-playing game?

**Tom Putzki:** All of us are enthusiastic role-playing gamers... [...]. So, what was the best choice for our first game as PIRANHA BYTES?

**Michael Hoge:** I always wanted to play "Ultima Underworld" via network. Nobody did me the favor to produce it, so weÂ´ve got to do it on our own. Actually, our game won't be too similar to "Underworld", but after all, it will be a 3D-RPG with action elements, so it would at best be compared to it than to any other game.

**Delekhan:** Why did you choose the medieval swords and sorcery genre?

**Stefan Nyul:** Few genres allow to build up such a <span class="demonic">dense atmosphere</span>. [...] In addition to that, the fantasy genre allows a wide variation for the player character. The mighty close combat-swordfighter, the clever and elusive archer, the vile cutthroat, the sinister fireball caster or the mystic controller of minds. Very different ways of mastering all the dangers.

**Michael Hoge:** When we started with GOTHIC, everyone used 3D engines to develop a 1st person shooter in a reality or sci-fi scenario and I was fed up with that. We liked the atmosphere of 3D games but wanted to bring a new aspect to it. Seems some other guys had the same idea. Fortunately, no one came too close to our vision of a 3D-RPG by now...


## Gameplay

**Delekhan:** [...] Is gameplay real-time or turn-based?

**Tom Putzki:** GOTHIC is a 3D-realtime-action-fantasy-RPG - nice title, isn't it?

**Delekhan:** [...] what do you think will make your project, GOTHIC, stand out in the hearts and minds of RPG fans?

**Stefan Nyul:** They will love it, because they don't have to learn the game. They just have to play it. No roleplaying game has ever had such <span class="demonic">easy to use</span> controls while still having very deep gameplay. You start the game with very easy quests that every player can accomplish though having a hard job to finish the game. 

**Michael Hoge:** Yes, some guys seem to work on swordfighting games and the like. Honestly, I believe that we can be in the top three titles from all of those. Why? We think we can differ a good idea from a bad one.


TODO add core gameplay stuff, monster puzzles etc.




## Summary

**Flosha:** Above I tried to collect the most relevant ideas of the Gothic devs on their conception of the game; the concepts that they considered essential for what Gothic is, which was already "touted by insiders for its breakthrough concepts" in 1998.  
Below I attempted to summarise the essential concepts behind Gothic based on our research and our own understanding as it has shaped over the years:  

(1) Story is defined as "the heart" of rpgs; as you are playing a role in a story (or "drama"), the rpg <em>has</em> to be story-driven and as it is a game it has to be driven <em>by</em> gameplay.  

(2) An rpg (and its story) is necessarily complex; the art of rpg design is to translate this complexity into gameplay by the most simple and intuitive interface; the means by which to achieve this simplicity is by radical visualisation and direct interaction instead of abstract statistics.  

(3) Exploration <em>of</em> and interaction <em>with</em> the gameworld and the simulated life therein is what this kind of gameplay is made of; they are the blood the heart is dealing with, the means by which the story is driven and told.
