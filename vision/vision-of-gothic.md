# THE VISION OF GOTHIC 

In the beginning there was an idea. 
Orpheus blabla.

Night (Nyx) is the beginning of all things.
This is the teaching of the Orphics.


Piranha Bytes was founded. And Orpheus was rescued.
It re-appeared like a Phoenix from the ashes.
Thus they have given it a new working title: "Phoenix".

Now they would make their own game in their own company.

> Though the German Developer PIRANHA BYTES has not even signed a distribution or 
publishing contract, it's already attracting tremendous attention from publishers and gamers.
> The word is that even highly anticipated games like Ultima: Ascension look dull compared with GOTHIC's highly detailed and incredibly fast engine. And the game is already being touted by insiders for its breakthrough concepts.

"One of those concepts is "optical feedback", meaning that increases in the character's ability are readily visible as the player's skill level develops."

**What's special about Gothic? Why is it different?** (IGN)

**Stefan:** Gothic is a roleplaying game for everyone. It's so easy to play the game, even my mother could do it, really. Gothic has the most intuitive and easiest user interface ever encountered around roleplaying games having this much content. And everything that has impact on the game, fighting, spellcasting, character-improvement can be seen in the gameworld rather than in dozens of menus or on character sheets with hundreds of numbers and tiny little bars. But under all this simplicity, there stands a full roleplaying game and no simple 3D shooter with swords.

Mike: It's true the games are getting better - in ways of graphical presentation but NOT, in my humble opinion, in ways of gameplay or a good story. Almost every fantasy game released recently is merely hack and slay but has practically no story. It's like the heart of the game has been ripped out! We will combine both a (hopefully) genuine story and an easy-to-use gameplay with an engine which is at a clearly higher technical level than RPGs normally used to have.

Tom: We founded Piranha Bytes because we wanted to produce games we want to play ourselves - that's what we want to achieve with Gothic.

**Delekhan:** Can you tell us the origin of Piranha Bytes? Who are the key individuals involved in the creation of GOTHIC? Have we encountered your work elsewhere?

**Stefan Nyul:** [...] At Piranha Bytes there is just one key individual and that's the team. Everybody's work for GOTHIC is vital and so it would be unfair to elevate someone above the others.

**Mike Hoge:** Forget about all the stuff we did before. [...] I had to carry out other people's instructions and ideas if I were confident with them or not. Mostly, I wasn't. That's why I got started with Piranha Bytes.

**Tom Putzki:**  We founded Piranha Bytes because we wanted to produce games we want to play ourselves - that's what we want to achieve with Gothic.


## Making of a fantasy RPG

**Delekhan:** Why did you decide to make a role-playing game?

**Tom Putzki:** All of us are enthusiastic role-playing gamers... [...]. So, what was the best choice for our first game as PIRANHA BYTES?

**Michael Hoge:** I always wanted to play "Ultima Underworld" via network. Nobody did me the favor to produce it, so we´ve got to do it on our own. Actually, our game won't be too similar to "Underworld", but after all, it will be a 3D-RPG with action elements, so it would at best be compared to it than to any other game.

**Delekhan:** Why did you choose the medieval swords and sorcery genre?

**Stefan Nyul:** Few genres allow to build up such a dense atmosphere. [...] In addition to that, the fantasy genre allows a wide variation for the player character. The mighty close combat-swordfighter, the clever and elusive archer, the vile cutthroat, the sinister fireball caster or the mystic controller of minds. Very different ways of mastering all the dangers.

**Michael Hoge:** When we started with GOTHIC, everyone used 3D engines to develop a 1st person shooter in a reality or sci-fi scenario and I was fed up with that. We liked the atmosphere of 3D games but wanted to bring a new aspect to it. Seems some other guys had the same idea. Fortunately, no one came too close to our vision of a 3D-RPG by now...


## Why "Gothic"?

**Delekhan:** "GOTHIC" is an interesting choice for the name of your game. Is it just a working-title or the actual title? 

**Tom Putzki:** [...] GOTHIC is the actual title of our game. I like that kind of music and people, the black scene. It's dark, gloomy, mysterious, creepy and magic - that's GOTHIC.

**Delekhan:** [...] Is gameplay real-time or turn-based?

**Tom Putzki:** GOTHIC is a 3D-realtime-action-fantasy-RPG - nice title, isn't it?


**Delekhan:** [...] what do you think will make your project, GOTHIC, stand out in the hearts and minds of RPG fans?

**Stefan Nyul:** They will love it, because they don't have to learn the game. They just have to play it. No roleplaying game has ever had such easy to use controls while still having very deep gameplay. You start the game with very easy quests that every player can accomplish though having a hard job to finish the game. 

**Michael Hoge:** Yes, some guys seem to work on swordfighting games and the like. Honestly, I believe that we can be in the top three titles from all of those. Why? We think we can differ a good idea from a bad one.


zoks.de 04/2000:
Sehr wahrscheinlich ist auch, daß die Piranhas Ex-Grufties sind. Und Grufties sind quasi der Rückzug einer romantischen Subkultur, die der politischen Kämpfe der Punker/Autonomen-Szenen überdrüssig war. Der dicke Robert von The Cure, Joy Division und Siouxsee and the Banshees waren klassische Gruftie-Bands, das aber nur am Rande.

"It is very likely that the Piranhas are Ex-Goths. And Goths are quasi the withdrawal of a romantic subculture that was weary of the political struggles of the punk/autonomous scenes."
