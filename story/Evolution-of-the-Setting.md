The initial idea of the Orpheus Concept (1996-1997) was the combination of two elements: *Escape from New York* and *Fantasy*. The setting was a mixture of the ideas in the film with dark fantasy, more precisely: ["gothic fantasy"](#gothicdefined). This is how Gothic was born and Orpheus was it's first working title. In this analysis, we will only consider the "setting" in the sense of the game world with its factions and the background story of how the situation comes about that the player is confronted with at the beginning of the game; what we will not deal with here are the plot as it unfolds in the actual game, nor with the lore in the sense of tradition, mythology, prophecies and the like; they have their own sections in the docs.

In the end of 1996 and the beginning of 1997 the Orpheus setting was roughly outlined in the "Orpheus - History" document as well as in "Orpheus Guilds" V1 and V2 which we released in 2020. Here we can already find almost all the important aspects of the background story. But in order to understand these early ideas and their development we also have to take the world design into account and how the different camps and guilds evolved in this earliest conception phase. According to all the notes available to us, this is the first concept of the setting: 

* The *prison colony* is established from the *outside world* as a **labour camp**. This was the basic differentiation they started with: Prison World and Outside World. The king, the war, the realms of the kingdom and all these details were not yet conceptionalised. At this point the game world was supposed to be an island as a limitation of the game world. The magical barrier was not yet invented.
* The convicts dig for **ore** below-ground and discover an old natural cave system. 
* There are monsters (Orcs), called by an *Entity*, dwelling in caves and attacking the miners; while the wardens are sitting in safety in their fortress and let them dig regardless.
* Motivated by the threat of the monsters, a **revolt** is initiated. The wardens are killed, but an escape fails at the so-called *cliff*, that is protected by forces from the outside world. It is here where the convicts are thrown into and it is here where the revolt is struck down. It is very likely that the idea of the barrier did not exist at this time, as it is not mentioned in the earliest summary and within the Orpheus Guild System V1 there is described an escape plan for the Mafia's thugs, which are dreaming of "taking the cliff by storm at night" someday. It is most likely in this context that a counter strike is mentioned with a question mark, as something that may have potentially being initiated. 
* The creation of a magical barrier (initially perhaps imagined as limited to the northern border of the colony, preventing the convicts to overcome "the cliff") could have happened as a reaction to the revolt, trying to gain back the control over the prison, but without success. Thus, the revolt would have taken place before the creation of the barrier, not in course of it as it was explained in the release version. In any way, the prison is now under control of the convicts, but they cannot escape; the cliff was the only way out of the prison and soon, due to the magical barrier, there would be none. 
* The outside world offers the convicts to work in the mines in exchange for benefits.
* In course of the revolt a new order is established by a group of the strongest; they form a Mafia who force the weak to continue to dig for ore; the "slave diggers", living in their own district in the city and in the old "diggers fort", they dig ore for the Mafia, exchange it with the outside world and pay their protection money from their miserly share to the thugs of the Mafia who protect them in the camp and from the monsters in the mine. The new order that promised freedom turned into just another kind of slavery, where the people living in the city couldn't trust anyone, since everyone could be a potential spy working for the Mafia; a system inspired by the Stasi of the former German Democratic Republic (DDR). 
* Other diggers decided to work independently, in free cooperation with the Outside World in a mine of their own and try to get the better of the monsters with ranged weapons and traps. They also deliver ore to the Outside World and receive goods in exchange, such as food, drugs, tools, animals and so on. They were called the "free diggers" living in a newer "diggers fort". 
* But "Bonzo" (which may have been a placeholder name that would later be described as "the Lord" and finally become "General Lee") is sick of it; he wants to confront the Outside World united, but the "weak" Diggers (who do not stand up against the Mafia) and the so described "Don't-Care-Guys" from Midcity (who prefer to maintain the Status Quo) are too big of a faction and cannot be convinced. 
* Thus Bonzo is splitting up with his guys, which are gladiators and "Outside world haters" first and foremost; as he doesn't want to (1) have any contact with the Outside world anymore and (2) hasn't enough influence in Midcity, thus founding what was originally called the gladiators camp. Later it would be called the "New camp" and the free diggers would evolve into the Free Miners, but at this point they were an independent "Free Camp" that was founded before the New Camp, with their own interests.
* Then the sect is founded, people are beginning to preach from a liberator, recruiting followers; visions start to occur and people struggle with their sleep; a fort is built for the sect to have them out of the way and they errect a temple.

This is the situation with which the player would be confronted. Mike wanted to show these things in the intro, that was supposed to introduce the setting, beginning with the prison colony itself over the revolt to the founding of the three camps. The escape plans did exist already, but they were not supposed to be shown as the player should find out about them ingame. The world corresponding to this earliest description of the setting can be roughly outlined as follows, all based on Mikes notes and sketches:

0. Outside World
1. Midcity Core (original Castle of the Wardens)
   1.1 Old Warden's house (relatively pretentious)
2. Midcity Outskirts (Fort)
3. Old Diggers Fort
   3.1 Underground Diggers HQ
4. Free Diggers Fort
5. Gladiators Camp
6. Psi Temple (Fort)
7. Mages Camp
8. Half Orcs in the forest
9. Old Mines (x3)
10. Natural Caves below the mines
11. Orccave(s) below the natural caves
12. Ancient Temple

This is a corresponding map sketch:

[include B-Scribbles page 11]

In the middle of the colony was supposed to be "Midstadt" (Midcity), the "liberal camp", as it was called because it was here that the convicts liberated themselves and initiated the revolt; establishing a new rule in the former prison castle and building the "outskirts" (the later outer ring of the camp). A short-lived difference was the mages being situated outside of the camp at a location of their own (the stonehenge and the mages meeting place in the forest may be what was left of it in later versions). But very soon they were put inside of the camp. The battle mages were placed inside the Midcity Core, the healing mages inside the New Camp (Gladiators Camp) and the Halforcs were transferred from the forest to the Free Camp, where they apparently were supposed to live in peace with the free diggers. 

[include B-scribbles page 12 (midcity core with mages inside)]

The simple differentiation was that there was one side in cooperation with the outside world, namely Midcity consisting of the Mafia, their Mercenaries (Thugs) and Spies, the Battlemages and the "slave diggers" on one hand and the Free Camp with their free diggers on the other hand. And one "Anti-Outside-World-Faction", which was the New Camp with the Healing Mages and their Mercenaries (the Gladiators). The Free Camp at this point was thought to be in alliance with the Sect, in that the templars of the sect helped to protect the free diggers against monsters, while the free diggers would exchange their ore for drugs or drug related ingrediences from the outside world as supplies for the Sect. Only after that, due to the link of the Gladiators with the Healing mages and their escape plan, the idea was formed that the Free diggers could eventually also cooperate with them. At this point, the free camp was thought to be in cooperation with both the New Camp and the Sect. It was a complex relationship. For instance, the Old Camp would extort road tolls from the free diggers in order to use the exchange place; or the "Ore thieves" (later Organisators) from the New Camp would steal ore not only from the old digger's fort, but occasionally from the free diggers too (even if against the mages orders due to the alliance).

[include B-scribbles page 13]

But at some point the free camp was no longer presented as a camp on their own and the cooperation with the Sect was no longer displayed, due to a demand for simplification by Alex Br√ºggemann. In order for the different relationships between the factions to not be too complex, he suggested that it has to be quite simple: One faction wants to get the ore out and one faction wants to keep the ore in; since the Anti-Outsideworld-Faction were the ones who didn't want to make business with the outside world at any cost and since they needed ore for their escape plan, the free diggers had to be closely linked to them. The former idea that they also traded at least some of their ore with the outside world was discarded for purposes of simplification. 

Another part of this simplification was the renaming of the Camps based on the simple idea that one camp was old and the other one was new; so from now on the Liberal Camp was called the Old Camp and the Gladiators Camp was called the New Camp. As a matter of fact, the so-called Old Diggers Fort of the original concept equals the later Old Fort ("Altes Kastell") in the south of the Old Camp, as I found out very late, just when I started to analyse the evolution of the setting in this form; apparently it never occured to anyone. The original positioning of the Old Mine was in the very south of the colony. It was this mine in which the slave diggers from the Old Camp were supposed to work and in the early notes it was made clear that only those diggers stayed inside of the Camp who were in a time-off (the diggers in the Old Camp switch between working and leisure on a weekly or two-weekly basis); the others stayed in the Old Diggers Fort which was situated close to the Old Mine. 

Regarding the barrier, now imagined as a closed sphere around the prison, was described as being created by battle mages; battle mages created the barrier and healing mages wanted to take it down. And at this point Mike had the idea that the battlemages also had some escape plan like creating a magical portal in the barrier, but would follow their plan only sporadically, as they have a good life in the centre of the Old Camp. In later iterations,after the Orpheus concept, the two circles - renamed into Circle of Fire and Circle of Water - were explained to have created it together. 

From here on the setting just evolved in minor ways. All the camps, all the guilds and all the essential parts of the background story were defined here, during the Orpheus Conception phase.

The barrier was round. The diameter was defined as 1km. The setting was set.



## Kings and Kingdoms

King Rhobar II. was introduced later, but can still be considered as part of the Alpha setting. He is mentioned both in the Comic and in version 0.94k by the judge during the conviction and described as the uniter of the four realms at the myrtanian sea. Rhobar I. on the other hand was never mentioned in any pre-release documents available to us nor in the game; he was introduced in the Gothic Manual which was neither written nor blessed by Mike Hoge. For Mike he is part of the setting, but he imagined that there were kings inbetween Rhobar I and Rhobar II, in opposition to the story in the Gothic Manual.

Myrtana was called *Martiana* in an earlier draft, thus marking it as the "Land of War" (Mars = Roman God of War). *Varant* and *Nordmar* are early ideas too, that were mentioned in the game. They are three of the four united realms. The fourth realm was never clearly defined as far as we can say at this moment, but for Mike it was *Khorinis*, while for others it was *Tymoris*, who have seen *Khorinis* just as the city or principiality within the tymorian kingdom.

**You are thrown in the prison**

The kingdom of Martiana is at war with the northern hordes.

In these times, criminals are thrown in the prison mine colony to provide the royal army with its most urgent need: iron ore.

There are no guards in the prison. The convicts run the mines by themselves. The precious ore is delivered to the outside world in exchange for food, medicine and some small luxuries.

But only the mightiest among the prisoners have the privilege to distirbute these goods among the others, while the weak ones are driven in the mines to get their little share.

The guards were no longer needed - no sane being can escape the prison, because the King's master mages put a psychic barrier around the prison colony to prevent every sane being from escape.

They'd better not.

Something has intervened with the fragile web of magic. 

Something that lies below the prison.

Below the mines.

Even below the natural caves.

In an unknown ancient temple, unchanged for 1000 years.

Something yet sleeping soon will awaken.

And an evil grin, unseen by living eyes, shows the knowledge that its human pray on the surface won't escape.

[To the phoenix analysis: On the other hand, this way the Free Camp lost their own identity to a point where the players did not perceive the Free diggers as an independent faction, it had no interest on its own, nor would it ever occur to the players that the free miners have founded their camp before the New Camp was established. Not only was a lot of interesting complexity lost in the relationship between the camps, the simplification also killed other story-relevant ideas, such as that the Brotherhood of Silence (the "Master" guild that the four friends belong to and that in the end couldn't find it's way into the game at all), were supposed to be the secret leaders of the Free Camp with a secret headquarter there. The brotherhood of silence was absolutely essential for the early immersive sim approach with the four classes, as they were one of the highest guilds and the path that the player was supposed to take as a thief to complete the game in the stealth way.

To Martiana: It is called Martiana, the land of war, not only because the war was spread from here to conquer all the surrounding realms, but because it is the land that was always plagued by war, the land where the cultures, tribes and religions collide and in which the conquests of Rhobar II. form only a very recent part of its long history of war throughout the centuries.

But very soon a few things changed. 










> Mike: [‚Ä¶] We needed to limit the size of the world, therefore we planned to place the prison on an island, but then we decided in favor of the magic barrier, because it emphasizes the feeling of being imprisoned. [voodooextreme.com, 14.11.1998](https://gothicarchive.org/interviews/1998/14.11.1998_voodooextreme.com.txt)

When the idea of a magical barrier came into play the world had no longer to be conceptionalised as an island; Mike himself formulated it this way in 1998 and other story authors and the Sequel team supposed that the island idea was obsolete and that the prison is situated on the main land, as it was only thought of as an island originally as a solution for the necessary limitation of the game world; as this limitation was solved differently the island idea was discarded. But as it was this idea that Mike had began with and that stayed in his imagination, after the barrier was gone and the world had still to be limited, the once discarded island idea was reused in the official successor.










* The Ore contains and preserves magical energy (Mana)
* There are three old mines.
