The Shitakkin have a pale skin and are supposed to be from Nordmar. The Nurrbin are inspired by african vodoo tribes and have a dark skin colour (they do not come from Varant, but from further south). Both of them are described in Alex' Story. The Myrin are the people of Myrtana; for the Mora see the respective document ([Mora](mora.md)), the priests and royals still consider themselves as being descendants of them. 

Just very few characters with the skin colour usually associated with those 'races' are directly descending from them. In most cases the superficial differences have other unrelated reasons, but that doesn't hinder some of them to proudly claim to be of noble blood or to accuse others of being inferior due to such differences.
