# Mythology



Lore of the Gods:

It seems that mythological and historical records are melting together in it, alongside the ideological colouration of the author, which is obviously a priest of fire based on his negative description of the water mages, of which he writes that they "[...] directed their prayers to Adanos and forgot their origin". He also informs us that (religious) wars were started in course of the split of the priests and that apparently the belief in the allmightiness of god became a myth. We interpret this to suggest that atheism or different kinds of faiths gained popularity (which, as we know, Rhobar took measures against, as the proclaimer of the faith in the three gods and claiming himself to be the governor of the highest god, RA - but this is something for the history section.)
