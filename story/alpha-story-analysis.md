*Is there something behind why you were thrown into the prison, or will it be revealed further into the story?*
[Tom Putzki]: Of course there is a reason...but at the beginning of the game the player doesn't know anything about it - the only thing he is absolutely sure about is: He is innocent. For more information you have to play the game ;-)
