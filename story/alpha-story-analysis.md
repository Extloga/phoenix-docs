# Alpha Story

**Author:** Flosha  
**Written:** 02.09.2023 - /

In order to analyse the original story concept of Gothic we have to differentiate between different phases of development. In course of time there were several iterations of the story that in the beginning evolved organically until the point of no return, where it had to be scrapped and was redone in the last couple of months in order to finish the game under the pressure of the publisher and time. The story was changed and reduced to such a degree, that the former story authors were confused and wondered what happened to the story when playing the final game. By summarising and comparing the narrative as it evolved until it was cut down to a fraction of it's original scope, we will be able to (1) point out the most comprehensive and profound iteration of the story and (2) clearly see whatever valuable is to be found in other iterations, (3) in order to harmonise the best of all in Phoenix; which is summarised in [Phoenix Story]().

We distinguish between the following versions or iterations of the Story.

```

1. Initial Orpheus Plot (1996)              | Plot V1
2. Early Phoenix Plot (1997-1999)           | Plot V2-3
3. Late Phoenix Plot (first half of 2000)   | Plot V3-4
4. First Cuts (second half of 2000)         | Plot V5
5. Release (2001)                           | Plot V6

```


## Orpheus (1996)

What was there from the very first concept:

* Earthquakes and visions happen that are thought to be related with the magical barrier.
* A Psi drug related with minecrawler secretion is essential and widespread both among humans and orcs to resist the madness.
* There are escape plans, only supposed to be revealed to the player in course of the story.
* The player experiences horrific visions of the Sleeper throughout the game and has a vision in a dream.
* He is lured into the camp of the psionics early on in the story to be involved in their plans (later "PrepareRitual" event). 
* The psi mages cause a madness wave in a mass ritual to awaken the Sleeper; earthquakes accompany the madness waves, resulting in the Old Mine being flooded (later "OmFull" event).
* A vision in the fire during the ritual: A dead paladin is seen in the ancient temple behind a door, that was besieged by the Undead, he has a weapon with him that can harm the Sleeper (later Uriziel). 
* In consequence of the ritual the Old Mine cannot deliver Ore anymore; thus at some point the Old Camp raids the Free Camp. New Camp and Old Camp turn hostile (later "FmTaken" event).
* The magic barrier is in disorder; according to the Demon evocator everyone is in danger.
* There is a magic amulet that has to be acquired to help against Madness, to come closer than ten meters to the (psychic) barrier without becoming mad (not defined why; perhaps to research the barrier and what is going on).
* At some point in the story there was supposed to be a mass event in form of a revolt against the barons, summarised in the sentence "Down with the Orebarons".
* The Sleeper was supposed to sleep at the foot of the barrier on a platform from stone. 
* At some point, the Sleeper awakens.
* Upon the threat of the awakening Sleeper, the Orcs flee to the Surface through the Free Mine; the New Camp is tarnished (later "OrcAssault" event).
* The surface is unsafe and the orcs "use" the marketplace (exchange place) for some reason.
* Open fights between the camps; the relationships go down resulting in chaos and overarching mutual killing sprees, secretly driven by the progressively more intense psi waves of the Sleeper that drives the whole colony insane (later "Nemesis" event).
* In some way the player enters the temple and tries to reach the deepest levels.
* There is a hood of a high priest (undefined whether orcish or human, but most likely orcish) to protect from the wrath of the Sleeper, which would be given as a reward (undefined by whom, but apparently by the priest himself as a reward for killing a specific powerful undead creature, such as the dragon below).
* But an Undead Dragon or a dragon-like creature (it was not decided) blocks the way in a defile on the path to the Sleeper. 
* Thus a weapon has to be found that enables to destroy the Undead.
* The player acquires the weapon from the vision in the paladin's cave in the temple, kills the dragon and somehow banishes the Sleeper.

This was all part of the earliest iteration of the story. What was not yet included at this point or at least not yet mentioned in the documents available to us are the Minecrawler Queen (MCQ); the specifics of the player's involvement in the plans of the Sect and their internal struggle for power; the specifics of the player's involvement in the plan of the Watermages; the specifics of the involvement with the Demon Evocator and his role (it is also not clear if he was supposed to be part of the battlemages at the start (as was the case in a later iteration) or if he was living in his demontower right from the beginning of the game, which is more likely); the specifics of how the player would get into the Orc Caves and the temple and what he would do there; and diverse connections of these different threads. 

While the most important story arcs were defined (and some of these most imporant story arcs were either not realised at all (to the regret of the developers, not because they rejected them) or heavily condensed), it was not yet sure what would lead to what and for which reason. Chapters were not yet introduced. 


## Phoenix (1997-1999)

The story described here is based on the earliest available story document, described as "Story 3.3", given to us in 2022. The Orpheus story outlined before can roughly be described as the "Story Version 1". That said, there was a story version 2 inbetween and we don't know anything about that. Perhaps it was just a transitional stage between the two without much or any additional information. But there is at least one difference we know of. In this stage the story was divided into chapters and at first there were supposed to be five. Thus we assume that the Story V2 can be identified with the story hinted at in the [Phoenix Pitch](), which mentions five chapters, while Story 3.3 has already six. 

The document is internally described as "Zusammenfassung Story-Meeting 27", that means, it is a summary of the 27th story meeting. The document was created in November 21th of 1995(!) and was updated last in May 24th of 1999[*]. 

[*] People keep saying that Gothic was in development for about 3 or so years, because it was 1998 that the ZenGin was started to be developed and the actual production, in a technical sense, went from 1998 to 2001 or the end of 1997, to be precise. But this only refers to the stage of development under the working title *Phoenix*. If the whole conception phase and the *Orpheus* stage is taken into account, then the development has started as early as 1995 and in this sense Gothic was in development for at least 5 years.

It is a document that was updated and evolved in the course of many years. Earlier iterations are most likely lost (unless some dev may still have an older backup), because the document was just constantly overwritten for years. A version control system was not yet in use. 

We cannot say for sure whether or not the addition of a sixth chapter was accompanied by the addition of any actual story content or if - and we assume so - it was mostly a structural change. As seen above, we can already find all the important story arcs in the Orpheus concept (and even more - like the rebellion against the barons which was either discarded, neglected or forgotten in later iterations); thus we do not think that there were any major changes in the story between Story V2 and Story V3. It seems that it was not much about what would happen, but why, about motivations, pacing and so on, because the Orpheus fragments raised many open questions in this regard. 

Story 3.3 consists of the following chapters (the english translation is from us): 

| CH        | Translation          | Original            |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Chapter 1 | Orientation phase    | Orientierungsphase  |
| Chapter 2 | Waves of Madness     | Wogen des Wahnsinns |
| Chapter 3 | Orcs and Ore Pirates | Orks und Erzpiraten |
| Chapter 4 | Mining War           | Minenkrieg          |
| Chapter 5 | Orc Assault          | Orksturm            |
| Chapter 6 | Nemesis              | Nemesis             |

The very different chapter names compared to the release version of the story are not a mere stylistic difference, but a reflection of the very different story that was developed at the time.

---

In this version of the story (maybe in version 2 already) the story writers, now consisting of [add names], introduced a system of dividing missions into priority 1, priority 2 and priority 3 missions. 

* Priority 1 are main missions, that bring the story forward. 
* Priority 2 are guild specific missions that often have some relation to the main mission. 
* Priority 3 are side missions with no relation to the main missions.

### Story Abstract as of May 1999

[Add here the story from the table in the Main Mission doc?]


## Phoenix (1999-2000)

The "Main Mission" document was apparently created at July 17th in 2000 and last updated in September 17th 2000. They were trying to finalise the story as late as September 2000, if not for longer, but at least an important part of the document has to be of an earlier date and was most likely copied from another document. Therefore we can distinguish two different story approaches with a few differences within the same document. 




*Is there something behind why you were thrown into the prison, or will it be revealed further into the story?*
[Tom Putzki]: Of course there is a reason...but at the beginning of the game the player doesn't know anything about it - the only thing he is absolutely sure about is: He is innocent. For more information you have to play the game ;-)

TODO:
* Add Psychic Barrier
* Add the Four Crystals of Trazere pictures and intro text.




**You are thrown in the prison**

The kingdom of Martiana is at war with the northern hordes.

In these times, criminals are thrown in the prison mine colony to provide the royal army with its most urgent need: iron ore.

There are no guards in the prison. The convicts run the mines by themselves. The precious ore is delivered to the outside world in exchange for food, medicine and some small luxuries.

But only the mightiest among the prisoners have the privilege to distirbute these goods among the others, while the weak ones are driven in the mines to get their little share.

The guards were no longer needed - no sane being can escape the prison, because the King's master mages put a psychic barrier around the prison colony to prevent every sane being from escape.

They'd better not.

Something has intervened with the fragile web of magic. 

Something that lies below the prison.

Below the mines.

Even below the natural caves.

In an unknown ancient temple, unchanged for 1000 years.

Something yet sleeping soon will awaken.

And an evil grin, unseen by living eyes, shows the knowledge that its human pray on the surface won't escape.
