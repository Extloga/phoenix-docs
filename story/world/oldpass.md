# Old Pass

09.09.2024

In Mikes [last known map sketch], by which he developed the Orpheus map further, he also introduced the pass. Before he has given us his design concepts, we knew the Old Pass only from an ingame map in vX.X, while there were no traces of it left in the game world apart from the texture of a path that was leading towards this position and suddenly ended in a mountain wall.  

We also knew it from an alpha screen, on which you could see that there was an actual path included that was leading through the mountains there.

At the entrance to this mountain there, you can see a palisade, which was contained in the data of the release version and the file name describes it as a `Trollpalisade`. It was Dmitriy, as far as I know, who connected these dots first, years before even our project was started, by speculating that the pass has been blocked due to a troll dwelling in the mountainous area behind. In 2022 we would be able to confirm this theory. 

The pass was cut in the last few months of development as it did not seem necessary and there was no time left to develop it any further (obviously there was no time  even to fix the mapping of the path). 




Judging from this depiction on the mal


In this aspect, I will argue, that the level designers fucked up big time.
