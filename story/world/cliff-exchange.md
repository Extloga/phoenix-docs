## Origins of the Cliff

What is not yet known and has been overlooked so far by alpha research, is that the idea of the *Cliff* is older than the idea of the barrier. And more than that, we have to assume, that it was the cliff which served (at the dawn of the Orpheus concept) as the first and primary level border. In the [Guild System v1](https://media.gothicarchive.org/documents/orpheus/OrpheusGuilds-V1.pdf), where every guild had its own position regarding a potential escape plan, it is written about the thugs (GRD) that they...

> *dream to take one night the Cliff by storm*

This dream implies, that overcoming the *Cliff* would enable them to escape. It also implies, that it was then supposed to be heavily guarded. In this earliest concept, described in the [Orpheus history](https://media.gothicarchive.org/documents/orpheus/Orpheus-B-Scribbles.pdf), *the revolt* had taken place (mainly motivated by the threat through the monsters that the wardens did not protect them from) and the royal forces were only able to stop them at the *Cliff*. From then on, the prison was under the control of the prisoners. 

But it wouldn't take long to the invention of the barrier.


## Position of the Cliff

What was also clear from the start, was that the *Exchange Place*, originally called *Marketplace*, was set directly in the north and on the [first known map sketch](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/mikehoge/maps/map1.jpg) by Mike, the cliff has been positioned directly north of the marketplace, with a lake below the cliff:

But this has then been changed in Mikes much more elaborated ["Orpheus Overview Map V1"](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/mikehoge/maps/map3.jpg) from 1996. While the marketplace stayed in the very north, the *Cliff of the Damned*, as it was called at the time, was not directly north of the marketplace anymore, but now positioned east of it. And the water into which the player was supposed to fall from the cliff, which has been drawn as a lake before, was now directly connected with the ocean; it was still between the marketplace and the cliff, but now, like the cliff itself, it was east of the marketplace, with a path in the north (behind the barrier) leading in a serpentine way towards the west.

The player was here not supposed to swim towards the marketplace, but towards the so called northern forest, from which a way (as you see it being drawn through the forest) would lead him to the Abandoned Mine south of the marketplace. Alex Wittmanns Gothic Novel was written with this map layout in mind and even the Gothic Comic (2000) has been made in accordance with this idea, where the marketplace is clearly seperated from the place at which the convicts arrive. The marketplace is of course connected to the cliff, but from another direction, as seen on the map.

In his next and the last known map sketch by Mike, he elaborated his former Orpheus map further. The ...

## Ralfs Concepts

The player would arrive here:

![Beginning of the Game in Ralfs Concepts](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V1_1.jpg)

He would walk through the hole in the mountain wall, over the tree alongside a waterfall, from where he would have a short sceneric view towards the Old Camp. Through a hole in the mountain wall again he would enter the lift, leading 80m down.

![Towards the Lift](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V1-2.jpg)

The lift would bring him into this area, where he could take a passage way towards the valley or another path leading to the Abandoned Mine. 

[Insert concept]

A path which through the placement of the rocks - which are hiding the passage to the valley from the perspective of the player when he arrives - would have been most likely for the player to take first. While when coming back from the mine, looking into the other direction, the path to the valley would become more obvious to him. But whichever path the player would take, he would leave them to arrive here at the "northern environment": 

![North of the Valley](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Abschnitt_A1-A2-B1-B2.jpg)

It should be obvious how these concepts deviated from Mikes conception. And if you look at the first picture above, you will see how Mike has added sketches to Ralfs concept to show him how he wants it to be, although it is difficult to interpret them. It was an usual process for him to draw over Ralfs concepts as a form of feedback to better explain to him how he imagined it instead *or* how Ralfs suggested design could be brought into harmony with Mikes idea. That said, he did not seem to approve this particular sketch due to how much it changed his idea. 

You also have to note how Ralf didn't include any incline (such as Mike had done on his map, where the area was supposed to lead upwards to the exchange place, as it was later realised in the game). Instead of having any organic inclination, Ralf has drawn rather strict straight paths, first horizontal, then a vertical path downwards in form of the lift and again a strict horizontal path to the valley. It is easier to design an area in this kind of way and becomes very complex if diverse inclinations have to be taken into account, as Mike wanted to have them.
