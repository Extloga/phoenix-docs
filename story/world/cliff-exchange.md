### Add to World Design: "Northern Environment"

The player would arrive here:

![Beginning of the Game in Ralfs Concepts](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V1_1.jpg)

He would walk through the hole in the mountain wall, over the tree alongside a waterfall, from where he would have a short sceneric view towards the Old Camp. Through a hole in the mountain wall again he would enter the lift, leading 80m down.

The lift would bring him into this area, where he could take a passage way towards the valley or another path leading to the Abandoned Mine. 

[Insert concept]

A path which through the placement of the rocks - which are hiding the passage to the valley from the perspective of the player when he arrives - would have been most likely for the player to take first. While when coming back from the mine, looking into the other direction, the path to the valley would become more obvious to him. But whichever path the player would take, he would leave them to arrive here at the "northern environment":

It should be obvious how these concepts deviated from Mikes conception. And if you look at the first picture above, you will see how Mike has added sketches to Ralfs concept to show him how he wants it to be, although it is difficult to interpret them. It was an usual process for him to draw over Ralfs concepts as a form of feedback to better explain to him how he imagined it instead *or* how Ralfs suggested design could be brought into harmony with Mikes idea. That said, he did not seem to approve this particular sketch due to how much it changed his idea. 

You also have to note how Ralf didn't include any incline (such as Mike had done on his map, where the area was supposed to lead upwards to the exchange place, as it was later realised in the game). Instead of having any organic inclination, Ralf has drawn rather strict straight paths, first horizontal, then a vertical path downwards in form of the lift and again a strict horizontal path to the valley. It is easier to design an area in this kind of way and becomes very complex if diverse inclinations have to be taken into account, as Mike wanted to have them.

#### Exchange Place and Cliff of the Damned

What was also clear from the start, was that the Exchange Place, originally called Marketplace, was imagined to be directly in the north. But while on the very first map sketch by Mike, titled "Orpheus Overview", the cliff was also directly north of the marketplace, with a lake below the cliff, this has been changed in Mikes much more elaborated "Orpheus Overview Map V1". While the marketplace stayed in the very north, the "Cliff of the Damned", as it was called, was not directly north of the marketplace anymore, but east of it. And the water into which the player was supposed to fall from the cliff, which has been drawn as a lake before, was now directly connected with the ocean; it was still between the marketplace and the cliff, but now, like the cliff itself, it was east of the marketplace. And the player was not supposed to swim towards the marketplace, but towards the so called northern forest, from which a way would lead him to the abandoned mine south of the marketplace. Alex Wittmanns Story "Sleeper's Ban" was written with this map layout in mind and the Gothic Comic has also being made in accordance with this idea.
