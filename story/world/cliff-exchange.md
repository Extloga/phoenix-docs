## Origins of the Cliff

What is not yet known and has been overlooked so far by alpha research, is that the idea of the *Cliff* is older than the idea of the barrier. And more than that, we have to assume, that it was the cliff which served (at the dawn of the Orpheus concept) as the first and primary level border. In the [Guild System v1](https://media.gothicarchive.org/documents/orpheus/OrpheusGuilds-V1.pdf), where every guild had its own position regarding a potential escape plan, it is written about the thugs (GRD) that they...

> *dream to take one night the Cliff by storm*

This dream implies, that overcoming the *Cliff* would enable them to escape. It also implies, that it was then supposed to be heavily guarded. In this earliest concept, described in the [Orpheus history](https://media.gothicarchive.org/documents/orpheus/Orpheus-B-Scribbles.pdf), *the revolt* had taken place (mainly motivated by the threat through the monsters that the wardens did not protect them from) and the royal forces were only able to stop them at the *Cliff*. From then on, the prison was under the control of the prisoners. 

But it wouldn't take long to the invention of the barrier.


## Mikes Design of the Cliff

It was defined from the start, that the *Exchange Place*, originally called *Marketplace*, was directly in the north and on the [first known map sketch](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/mikehoge/maps/map1.jpg) by Mike the cliff has been positioned directly north of the marketplace, with a lake below the cliff:

![Cliff & Marketplace v0](/_img/world/cliff-marketplace-v0.jpg)

But this has then been changed in Mikes much more elaborated ["Orpheus Overview Map V1"](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/mikehoge/maps/map3.jpg) from 1996. While the marketplace stayed in the very north, the *Cliff of the Damned*, as it was called at the time, was not directly north of the marketplace anymore, but now positioned east of it. And the water into which the player was supposed to fall from the cliff, which has been drawn as a lake before, was now directly connected with the ocean; it was still between the marketplace and the cliff, but now, like the cliff itself, it was east of the marketplace, with a path in the north (behind the barrier) leading in a serpentine way towards the west. 

![Cliff & Marketplace v1](/_img/world/cliff-marketplace-v1.jpg)

The player was here not supposed to swim towards the marketplace, but towards the so called northern forest, from which a way (as you see it being drawn through the forest) would lead him to the Abandoned Mine south of the marketplace. Alex Wittmanns Gothic Novel was written with this map layout in mind and even the Gothic Comic (2000) has been made in accordance with this idea, where the marketplace is clearly seperated from the place at which the convicts arrive.

In his next and the last known map sketch, Mike elaborated his former Orpheus map further. While the marketplace and the cliff stayed just as they were, the northern lake became changed in appearance in that it did now stretch further into the west, but less into the south, due to the introduction of a new river, that would flow south of the northern forest, from the northwest into the sea in the east; this river would remain there till the release version of the game. This change did not affect the gamestart as originally imagined, but it changed the distance to the abandoned mine, which was now on the other side of the river, behind the bridge and not so close to the northern forest as it was in the Orpheus map.

The Abandoned Mine (VM) more south behind the bridge, while in the east the originally imagined position of the stone circle is seen.

## Ralfs Concept Art

When Ralf started to draw concepts of the surface for review by Mike, he diverted quite a bit from Mikes original ideas. Partially this may have been caused by a misunderstanding. Which we will explain further below. On one hand, he has drawn this concept of the "starting location":

![Starting location](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V2_1.jpg)

Obviously, this is his version of the cliff. You can see a lake and he thought of an influx of water in the east, which was the opposite of Mikes idea, where this water would run towards the east into the ocean and was not drawn as a seperate lake. 
But he also did draw this:

![Beginning of the Game in Ralfs Concepts](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V1_1.jpg)

Here the player would walk through the hole in the mountain wall, over the tree alongside a waterfall, from where he would have a short sceneric view towards the Old Camp. Through a hole in the mountain wall again he would enter the lift, leading 80m down. 

![Towards the Lift](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V1-2.jpg)

The lift would bring him into this area, where he could take a passage way towards the valley or another path leading to the Abandoned Mine:

![Ralfs Lift](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_VerlasseneMine_Fahrstuhl.jpg)

A path which through the placement of the rocks - which are hiding the passage to the valley from the perspective of the player when he arrives - would have been most likely for the player to take first. While when coming back from the mine, looking into the other direction, the path to the valley would become more obvious to him Whichever path the player would take, he would leave them to arrive here at the "northern environment": 

![North of the Valley](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Abschnitt_A1-A2-B1-B2.jpg)

At first it may seem, that these two concepts, the one with the lift and the one with the higher cliff and the lake, are like two different concepts for the players way into the colony, as this second concept is overwritten with "Anfang" (start), and the first one with "starting location". They also cannot be connected, because in the first concept he connotes "zum Baum" (*to the tree*) as the only path out of this area. And we have to assume that with "tree" he is referring to the hangmen's tree. This means that he would just walk through this opening in the rock face and then through the forest towards the hangmen's tree. 

Ralf didn't include any noteworthy rise in the terrain (such as Mike had done on his map, where the area was supposed to lead upwards to the exchange place, as it was later realised in the game). Instead of having any organic inclination, Ralf has drawn rather strict straight paths, first horizontal, then a vertical path downwards in form of the lift and again a strict horizontal path to the valley. It is easier to design an area in this kind of way and becomes very complex if diverse inclinations have to be taken into account, as Mike wanted to have them. 

But if we assume that Ralf has seen Mikes Orpheus map before (which is very likely), and that he based his concept on it, we also could argue, that he may have misinterpreted the shore of the water at the bottom of the cliff and the marketplace, with mountain walls. The "opening" that Mike has drawn in the Orpheus map to connote that he would enter the forest here from the shore, he may have interpreted as an exit instead from the mountains into the forest. In this case, the following image may make it easier to imagine the layout:

![North of the Valley](/_img/world/ralf-start-exits.jpg)

In this case the two concepts above may indeed belong to the same time and show two separate locations; the first concept would show the cliff, which you would exit through a crack in the mountains somewhere behind the forest (red), while the second concept(s) would show the marketplace, with the panorama view towards the Old Camp (blue) and the exit from the lift (green).

The huge lift drawn by Ralf could be the realisation of what the long pole-like scribble seen on Mikes Orpheus map should be. Why would Mike signify the marketplace with this huge pole in his sketch, if not to suggest a very high lift used for the exchange of the goods? If he would have imagined a ropeway, as it was introduced later, he surely would have drawn a line towards the cliff in the north or to the east over the water in front of the cliff. 

It should be obvious how these concepts deviated from Mikes conception. And if you look at the second picture above, you will see how Mike has added sketches to Ralfs concept to show him how he wants it to be, although it is difficult to interpret them. It was an usual process for him to draw over Ralfs concepts as a form of feedback to better explain to him how he imagined it instead *or* how Ralfs suggested design could be brought into harmony with his ideas. 

That said, he did not seem to approve this particular sketch due to how much it changed his idea. <!-- And just like me at first, it seems that Mike has interpreted this concept to be Ralfs suggestion for the cliff, the place of arrival for the player; which would mean, that there was not even water for the player to fall into. --> In any way we should take a closer look at what Mike has drawn unto the concept:

![Mikes feedback](/_img/world/mikes-feedback-to-ralfs-concept-1.jpg)

In his scribble he basically repeated what he had drawn in his Orpheus map and his final map sketch shown above. It seems clear that he did not want the cliff to be hidden in a deep circular valley, as Ralf had imagined it. From the cliff the player was meant to have an overview almost of the entire colony, as described both in the comic and the novel, where the protagonist could even see the Psi Camp from afar. He also seemed to insist on a position of the cliff in the east of the marketplace. 


### Pre-Alpha World Models

Now we come to the surface models from january to march 1999, contained within v0.56c. The oldest model of the surface that we have, is from January 4, 1999. Here the area in question looked like this:

![Model-04-01-1999](/_img/world/surface-1999-01-04-details.png)

In the second oldest available model from January 22, the forest was reduced in size and the Troll Canyon was added into that pass area. In the latest model available in v0.56c from 1th March, basically nothing had changed from the model in January 22, but they had replaced all the old forests with mountains in the new octagonal shape, since Mike had envisioned the new forest system, where every forest would be divided into such octagonals. The mountains were never meant to replace the forests, they were placeholder models for the new forests to come. 

![Model-01-03-1999](/_img/world/surface-1999-03-01-details.png)

In this version of the map, it is unclear where the Abandoned Mine was supposed to fit. Most likely it was meant to be directly below the exchange place alongside those mountains, as done in later versions too. It may look as if this wouldn't fit there, but the proportions of the map are misleading, since the placeholder structures beyond the barrier are so huge, that they let the area within the barrier and around the marketplace to look small, while actually there is quite a bit of space there. 

The entire model was done very roughly and around the camps (which were already much more elaborated, the Old Camp almost final), in order to get an idea. A lot of things were bound to change, but at least it had managed to preserve the overall layout of Mikes concepts.


### Alpha World Models

In about v0.7, the exchange place was now looking like this:

![Exchange Place v0.7](/_img/world/cliff-07.png)

It is here, that for the first time the ropeway appears, that players would know from this screenshot and the [gameplay video of the PC Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yABtkrQonD0) and would anticipate to be in the game.

![Exchange Place v0.7](/_img/world/pcaction-ropeway.png)

Sadly it was removed and replaced by a much less iconic lift in the end. 

Since we do not have a copy of this version of the world, we can not know for sure, if the cliff and the exchange place were already merged in this version. It also could be that this world was still a mixture of the earlier and later design in that there may have been a seperated cliff further east. But this is very unlikey - since the early "Old Temple" (later Monastery ruins) did also appear in this version and so there was no room for any water anymore that the player could have fallen down into from the cliff. Therefore, from version 0.7 onwards, the cliff and the exchange place were merged again into one, as it was on the very first scribble of Mike during the Orpheus conception.
