## Origins of the Cliff

What is not yet known and has been overlooked so far by alpha research, is that the idea of the *Cliff* is older than the idea of the barrier. And more than that, we have to assume, that it was the cliff which served (at the dawn of the Orpheus concept) as the first and primary level border. In the [Guild System v1](https://media.gothicarchive.org/documents/orpheus/OrpheusGuilds-V1.pdf), where every guild had its own position regarding a potential escape plan, it is written about the thugs (GRD) that they...

> *dream to take one night the Cliff by storm*

This dream implies, that overcoming the *Cliff* would enable them to escape. It also implies, that it was then supposed to be heavily guarded. And it means, that the guild system v1 is older than the idea of the barrier. In this earliest concept, described in the [Orpheus history](https://media.gothicarchive.org/documents/orpheus/Orpheus-B-Scribbles.pdf), *the revolt* had taken place (mainly motivated by the threat through the monsters that the wardens did not protect them from) and the royal forces were only able to stop them at the *Cliff*. From then on, the prison was under the control of the prisoners. 

But it wouldn't take long to the invention of the barrier.


## Mikes Design of the Cliff

It was defined from the start that the *Exchange Place*, originally called *Marketplace*, was directly in the north and on the [first known map sketch](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/mikehoge/maps/map1.jpg) by Mike the cliff has been positioned north of the marketplace, with a lake below the cliff:

![Cliff & Marketplace v0](/_img/world/cliff-marketplace-v0.jpg)

But this has then been changed in Mikes much more elaborated ["Orpheus Overview Map V1"](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/mikehoge/maps/map3.jpg) from 1996. While the marketplace stayed in the very north, the cliff was not directly north of the marketplace anymore, but now positioned east of it. And the water into which the player was supposed to fall from the cliff, which has been drawn as a lake before, was now directly connected with the ocean; it was still between the marketplace and the cliff, but now, like the cliff itself, it was east of the marketplace, with a path in the north (behind the barrier) leading in a serpentine way towards the west. 

![Cliff & Marketplace v1](/_img/world/cliff-marketplace-v1.jpg)

The player was here not supposed to swim towards the marketplace, but towards the so called northern forest, from which a way (as you see it being drawn through the forest) would lead him to the Abandoned Mine south of the marketplace. Alex Wittmanns Gothic Novel was written with this map layout in mind and even the Gothic Comic (2000) has been made in accordance with this idea, where the marketplace is clearly seperated from the place at which the convicts arrive.

At this point in development the two locations where listed in separation in the level design docs of the Phoenix Concept. The cliff was described as *Die Klippe der Verdammnis* (Cliff of the Damned*), as the convicts would be convicted here and damned to a life long prison sentence in the penal colony. Some died upon arrival. It was meant to be three or four times as high as the cliff in the release version. And from the cliff the player was meant to have an overview almost of the entire colony, as described both in the comic and the novel, where the protagonist could even see the Psi Camp from afar.

In his next and the last known map sketch, Mike elaborated his former Orpheus map further. While the marketplace and the cliff stayed just as they were, the northern lake changed in appearance in that it did now stretch further into the west, but less into the south, due to the introduction of a new river, that would flow south of the northern forest, from the northwest of the colony (it would later become connected to the New Camp) into the sea in the east; this river would remain there till the release version of the game. This change did not affect the gamestart as originally imagined, but it changed the distance to the abandoned mine, which was now on the other side of the river, behind the bridge and not so close to the northern forest as it was in the Orpheus map. 

![Cliff & Marketplace v2](/_img/world/cliff-marketplace-v2.jpg)

{: .caption }

Please note that in both maps, Mike had always signified the marketplace by this scribble of a high reaching pillar-like structure. What does it mean? Most likely, he imagined a very high lift here, as it would later be drawn by Ralf. 


## Ralfs Concept Art

When Ralf started to draw concepts of the surface for review by Mike, he diverted quite a bit from Mikes original ideas. Partially this may have been caused by a misunderstanding, which we will explain further below. On one hand, he has drawn this concept of the "starting location":

![Starting location](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V2_1.jpg)

Obviously, this is his version of the cliff. You can see a lake and he thought of an influx of water in the east, which was the opposite of Mikes idea, where this water would run towards the east into the ocean and was not drawn as a seperate lake. Ralf thereby removed the water directly in the north of the northern forest that the player was meant to arrive at. Instead of the water there was now a thick mountain wall between the forest and a smaller, separated lake within this starting area with the cliff surrounded by vast rock faces.  
But he also did draw this:

![Beginning of the Game in Ralfs Concepts](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V1_1.jpg)

Here the player would walk through the hole in the mountain wall, over the tree alongside a waterfall, from where he would have a short sceneric view into the colony towards the Old Camp. Through a hole in the mountain wall again he would enter the lift, leading 80m down. 

![Towards the Lift](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V1-2.jpg)

The lift would bring him into this area, where he could take a passage way towards the valley or another path leading to the Abandoned Mine:

![Ralfs Lift](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_VerlasseneMine_Fahrstuhl.jpg)

A path which through the placement of the rocks - which are hiding the passage to the valley from the perspective of the player when he arrives - would have been most likely for the player to take first. While when coming back from the mine, looking into the other direction, the path to the valley would become more obvious to him. Whichever path the player would take, he would leave them to arrive here at the "northern environment": 

![North of the Valley](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Abschnitt_A1-A2-B1-B2.jpg)

It seems that these two concepts, the one with the lift and the one with the higher cliff and the lake, are two different concepts for the players way into the colony, as this second concept is overwritten with "Anfang" (start), and the first one with "starting location" and in both cases Ralf described the way from above towards the valley, as if the player would arrive here.

In case of the lift this must be the case, because the reason that the lift was imagined to be 80m high is that most likely it was meant to be within the barrier at the bottom and outside of the barrier at the top; this at least is what Mikes early maps suggest. In this case the player would not have been able to take the lift a second time; it was the lift for the exchange of the goods.  

They also cannot be connected, because in the first concept he connotes "zum Baum" (*to the tree*) as the only path out of this area and we have to assume that with "tree" he is referring to the hangmen's tree. So he would just walk through this opening in the rock face and then through the forest towards the hangmen's tree. 

Ralf also had not included any noteworthy rise in the terrain (such as Mike had done on his map, where the area was supposed to lead upwards to the exchange place, as it was later realised in the game). Instead of having any organic inclination, Ralf has drawn rather strict straight paths, first horizontal, then a vertical path downwards in form of the lift and again a strict horizontal path to the valley. It is easier to design an area in this kind of way and becomes very complex if diverse inclinations have to be taken into account, as Mike wanted to have them.
{: .subtext }

But if we assume that Ralf has seen Mikes Orpheus map before (which is very likely), and that he based his concept on it, we also could argue, that he may have misinterpreted the shore of the water at the bottom of the cliff and the marketplace, with mountain walls. The "opening" that Mike has drawn in the Orpheus map to connote that he would enter the forest here from the shore, he may have interpreted as an exit instead from the mountains into the forest. In this case, the following image may make it easier to imagine the layout:

![North of the Valley](/_img/world/ralf-start-exits.jpg)

In this case the two concepts above may indeed belong to the same time and show two separate locations; the first concept would show the cliff, which you would exit through a crack in the mountains somewhere behind the forest (red), while the second concept(s) would show the marketplace, with the sceneric view towards the Old Camp (blue) and the exit from the lift (green). But if so and kf the player would arrive via the cliff, the player would never have been able to take the lift and see the top; he would never walk over the tree and so forth. Therefore it remains most likely, that these two sketches show two different approaches to the cliff/marketplace.  

The lift drawn by Ralf could be the realisation of what the long pillar-like scribble seen on Mikes Orpheus map should be. Why would Mike signify the marketplace with this huge pillar in his sketch, if not to suggest a very high lift used for the exchange of the goods? If he would have imagined a ropeway, he surely would have drawn a line towards the cliff in the north or to the east over the water in front of the cliff. But the idea of a ropeway - as it was later realised in v0.7 and also shown in the Comic - was not yet around. 

Although there is at least a hint that Ralf may still involved when the idea of the lift was replaced by the idea of a ropeway, in that we have a concept by Ralf of a *Gondel*. But this could as well have been attached to a ropeway as it could have been attached to the lift:  

[gondelpicture]

It should be obvious how these concepts deviated from Mikes conception. And if you look at the second of Ralfs sketches above, you will see how Mike has added some scribbles to Ralfs concept to show him how he wants it to be, although it is difficult to interpret them. It was an usual process for him to draw over Ralfs concepts as a form of feedback to better explain to him how he imagined it instead *or* how Ralfs suggested design could be brought into harmony with his ideas. 

That said, he did not seem to approve this particular sketch due to how much it changed his idea. <!-- And just like me at first, it seems that Mike has interpreted this concept to be Ralfs suggestion for the cliff, the place of arrival for the player; which would mean, that there was not even water for the player to fall into. --> But we should take a closer look at what Mike has [drawn unto the concept](/_img/world/mikes-feedback-to-ralfs-concept-1.jpg). In his scribble he basically repeated what he had drawn in his Orpheus map and his final map sketch. It seems clear that he did not want the cliff to be hidden in a deep circular valley, as Ralf had imagined it, as thereby the player would have no view of the colony anymore when standing on the cliff. He also seemed to insist on a position of the cliff in the east of the marketplace and to keep the water between the cliff and the northern forest. 

In the first world models in the pre-alpha versions of the game, it would be implemented accordingly.  


## Pre-Alpha World Models

In v0.56c we can find surface models from january to march 1999. The oldest model of the surface that we have, is from January 4. Here the area in question looked like this:

![Model-04-01-1999](/_img/world/surface-1999-01-04-details.png)

In the second oldest available model from January 22, the forest was reduced in size and the Troll Canyon was added into that pass area. In the latest model available in v0.56c from 1th March, basically nothing had changed from the model in January 22, but they had replaced all the old forests with mountains in the new octagonal shape, since Mike had envisioned the new forest system, where every forest would be divided into such octagonals like a honey comb (this system was introduced here and used till the release). The mountains were never meant to replace the forests, they were placeholder models for the new forests to come. 

![Model-01-03-1999](/_img/world/surface-1999-03-01-details.png)

In this version of the map, it is unclear where the Abandoned Mine was supposed to fit. Most likely it was meant to be directly below the exchange place alongside those mountains, as done in later versions too. It may look as if this wouldn't fit there, but the proportions of the map are misleading, since the placeholder structures beyond the barrier are so huge that they let the area within the barrier and around the marketplace look small, while actually there is a lot of space there. 

The entire model was done very roughly and around the camps (which were already much more elaborated, with the Old Camp almost final), in order to get an idea. A lot of things were bound to change, but at least it had managed to preserve the overall layout of Mikes concepts.


## Alpha World Models

In about v0.7, the whole mountain terrain in the north was modeled with a very steep rise in the terrain. The exchange place was now looking like this:

![Exchange Place v0.7](/_img/world/cliff-07.png)

It is here, that for the first time the ropeway appears, that players would know from this screenshot and the [gameplay video of the PC Action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yABtkrQonD0) and would anticipate to be in the game. Later it would be removed and replaced by a much less iconic and much smaller lift in the end.

At first the lake at the exchange place was simply designed as a lake in a basin of mountainous terrain, with no room between the lake and the mountains. There was not meant to be any kind of storage or a camp here and no room for it. The convicts would bring the ore to this place, once every month, they would receive their goods from the outside world and deliver their ore by using the gondola, then bring the goods to the Old Camp. In the Comic this process is shown in connection with a carriage and horses, but still - there is no storage here and no reason for it.

Accordingly there also was no gate to protect the exchange place, as there was nothing to protect (other than the ropeway itself); there was no ore here obviously, as it was all delivered outside and there were no goods from the outside world here, as they were all brought to the camp.

![Exchange Place to AM v0.7](/_img/world/087.png)

{: .caption }

There would be no gate here till around v0.94k. In screenshots of v0.9 it is still not included. And the screenshot suggested orcs to arrive here. An idea that may not only have been set up for the screenshot, since the orcs occupying the exchange place is an idea that traces back all the way to the earliest Orpheus notes. 

[Add 0.9 Screen]

Although we do not have a copy of the world from v0.7, we can say for sure, that the cliff and the exchange place were already merged. While in theory we could imagine a mixture of this exchange place with a seperate cliff further east, this is very unlikey to be the case - since the early "Old Temple" (later "Monastery ruins") did also appear in this version and so there was no room for any water anymore that the player could have fallen down into from the cliff. Therefore, from version v0.7 onwards, the cliff and the exchange place were merged again into one, as it was on the very first scribble by Mike during the Orpheus conception.

The position, as far as we know, did not change from here on. The cliff was slightly higher than in the release version, but in both cases the player was unable to see the colony. All the ideas regarding the gamestart with the northern forest (which was also removed completely) and the cliff as a separate location, where thereby discarded. 

The Abandoned Mine did now also find its place in the world in 0.7, although originally only the entrance or entrances on the right (in the west) were modeled, as seen on this screenshot:

[alpha Am]

While almost nothing of Ralfs ideas for the exchange place (nor for the Abandoned mine) remained (other than getting rid of the water connected to the sea), we could see the bridge that was added to the Abandoned Mine as a later version of Ralfs tree between the cracks in the rock faces. Just as in Ralfs idea, the player would have a very sceneric view of at least the Old Camp from this position. 

And while in the earliest pre-alpha models all the terrain had been completely flat, similar to how Ralf had drawn it, the rise in the terrain (which Mike wanted to have) in this model was now so steep, that it made it hard to believe that any kinds of wagons could be drawn up the path easily. And certainly not by humans. The path from the Abandoned Mine did now lead down and through the mountains, ending roughly at the position where later Drax and Ratford would have been placed. This screenshot shows the path up to the exchange place in v0.7X:  

[...]

While here as well as a number of similar screenshots you can see how there was no path yet at the outside of the mountain wall:

[...]

All of these details about changes in the world model in different versions were found by us, namely Dmitriy, Vaana and Flosha, in course of many years of research in between 2015 to 2018, long before we did have any access to alpha versions containing said world models. And some of them we still have not found any copies of.

## Summary

The ingame implementation got rid of several of the early ideas:  
* There wss no longer a connection of the water/lake below the cliff to the sea, nor was there any waterfall or river that would explain the water in the lake, nor did it have any outflow.
* The connection to the northern forest was lost - and the northern forest itself has been removed, inspite of its dominant role in all map concepts, pre-alpha models and the novel.
* The player could not see the colony from the cliff. 
* The cliff was tiny in comparison to the originally imagined cliff - it was meant to be much higher. 
* The ropeway was a much better idea than the lift; but the idea of the lift was thereby also discarded.
* While not dealt with here, it also affected the design of the Abandoned Mine, which was discarded in the form that Ralf had imagined it. 


## Phoenix Solutions

* We did not want to get rid of the general design of the terrain of the exchange place and the Abandoned Mine from the Alpha versions, as the design of this terrain is very good and it is the only and thereby the first and last ingame implementation of the exchange place and the Abandoned Mine.

* As for changes, at first we reconstructed the iconic ropeway from v0.7, which is not just a visual improvement or a change motivated by nostalgia, but the way that the ropeway is setup also makes it more believable that it was constructed after the creation of the barrier in a joint effort from within and outside the barrier by pulling and pushing the central pillar up, stabilised by thick ropes.

* We then thought about how, while preserving the above mentioned terrain and setup, we could include the...
  * Connection to the sea with a potential seperate cliff
  * Northern forest (connected to that sea)
  * 80m Ore lift connected to the Abandoned Mine Concept Arts


### Northern Forest Implementation

The northern forest seemed the easiest to solve among them, although it already required big changes in the word model, in course of which the position of the Exchange Place and the Abandoned Mine changed and all the objects (Vobs) had to be brought over to the new position.

There simply was no space for the northern forest, as the mountain range began immediately behind the river. But when compared with the release version, in the pre-alpha models of the world the northern environment did stretch further into the north. So in order to implement the northern forest, I had to make room between the northern river and the mountain path towards to exchange place, shifting the entire mountain area further into the north to make room for the forest. 

And by implementing the northern forest and thereby increasing the distance between the northern bridge (in front of the Old Camp) and the mountain path towards the valley, I also could become able to decrease the steepness of the rise in the terrain towards the exchange place by letting this rise start with the northern forest already (as Mike had suggested it on his sketch), thereby distributing this rise more evenly. 


### Connection to the Sea

But how could I connect the forest when implemented like this (and I did so already - *twice*, in two different approaches - a work that would later turn out to have been at least halfway in vain) to the water that was meant to be connected to the sea?

If following the concepts more radically, I would not really have needed to make more room between the river and the exchange place (although this increased room may still necessary in order to later make room for the increased distance between the Old Camp and the river with the bridge known from the pre-alpha models). What I actually would have needed to do, is to place the exchange place much further down (a bit closer to the sea level), thereby removing most of the mountain terrain around the path leading down into the valley; there would still have to be a rise in the terrain, but it would even out a lot more and be much less steep. 

Instead of walking from the exchange place down the path arriving at the Abandoned Mine, the player would arrive at the forest instead.

The forest would then reach to where from at least 0.8 onwards there was the plateau in the northwest of the Abandoned Mine; this plateau and some mountains is basically the only thing that would disappear; or rather: There would just be a forest covering it, all the way towards the river north of the Old Camp.  

If the terrain would thereby be positioned much deeper, we would have room for the seperate cliff here with a very sceneric view over the entire colony, while the view from the exchange place would be the same as known - almost.
Because there would have to be a waterfall here, at the exchange place, or higher up in the mountains west of it, that would on one hand flow into the lake at the exchange place, but then also (in a very organic way and in form of several steps), flow down into the southwest (south from the perspective of the exchange place), north of the forest but south of the cliff. And from here this water would then agaim flow down in one or wide steps/waterfalls towards the ocean. 

That this water cannot be at the exact same height as the ocean itself and has to flow down in some way and at some point or another, we can consider as something that Mike had already in mind, because the forest terrain was supposed to rise north, so it would rise quite a bit up compared to the ocean and the river south of it (that also flows into the ocean), while the water north of it was meant to be not too much lower than the forest, since the convicts should arrive here at the shore.

But the forest being at least a little bit higher than the level of the lake north of it makes sense, as thereby we could steer the way that the player can exit the sea through the level design. As he then could not swim towards the right (east), nor to the west (where he would fall down the waterfalls) nor could he exit the water at any other point of the forest and thereby avoiding the thugs awaiting him - this way through the design of the terrain I could make sure that the player is forced to swim at this very bay and not anywhere else.   


### Abandoned Mine

With this solution, the path along the Abandoned Mine would still remain as is. It would be the path as drawn on the earliest concepts, leading from the exchange place to the camp at the eastern edges of the northern forest, just in a less steep way. And the Abandoned Mine would then be in the east of the forest, as in Mikes Orpheus map.

As for Ralfs concepts of the mine: The mine was here basically drawn as a path, with rock faces left and right, some broken houses and additional clefts in the mountains leading into the mining sites. The position of it would have been in the west of the exchange place, southwest perhaps, and the path would lead towards the west too; this at least is what his concept of the lift suggests, where we see the direction of the north and an arrow pointing towards the Abandoned Mine in a path to the left. 

Now, in Ralfs concepts, this path is positioned much lower, 80m to be exact, then the cliff. This would not be the case with the Abandoned Mine area from 0.7-0.9 that we keep. But just as the Abandoned Mine we know is not just one site, but a collection of several mining sites on both sides of the mountains, the area already suggests, that the Abandoned Mine as a term is the name of an entire terrain of mining sites. 

That said, the area from Ralfs concepts can very well co-exist next to the area a it has been implemented. It would rather increase the area and serve as additional territory to explore. 

According to the concept, the lift would be placed close to the exchange place; and at this point, at least in Mikes idea, be there 



---

While all of this sounds as if I could thereby not only come much closer to the original concepts but also improve the believability of the terrain in a very organic way - there is one big problem with this solution. This "second" lake behind the forest and below the new (or older) cliff and especially its connection to the sea would have to be exactly where the Old Temple (Monastery Ruins) has been placed in 0.7 onwards. 


### Relocating the Old Temple

How to solve this problem? I could try to somehow combine the temple with this change in the terrain; the temple would then quasi be located between the lake and the ocean, with the waterfalls running into the ocean north of it or both north and south of it, with the ruins being placed on a mountain hill inbetween all this water. This could work indeed. While the Old Temple design is much better and more coherent than the ruins of the release version, the terrain in the Alpha that leads towards and surrounds it was still very blank. The water could improve this. 

While the mountain massives north of the Old Temple that also can be seen in the old gameplay videos and screnshots from afar, would become part of the new cliff. 

Alternatively, the Old Temple and its entire area would have to be relocated to a different position in the Colony.
