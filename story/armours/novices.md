# Psi Novice Clothes

First deal with the novice skirt/wide pants from 0.57c.


From the Screenshots of ~v0.7 we know that the more or less final novice clothing with the naturally-coloured robe and the shoulder plate (as a re-design of the former novice robe from 0.64b), did for some time co-exist with the red skirt that we do not have any detailed screenshot of. The red robe as inspired by buddhists and as described in Alex Wittmann's novel.
