## EBR
Conspired leaders of the Revolt, united by the torture they suffered, constituting a Mafia ruling the ore business, conceiving themselves as revolutionary successors of the tymorian orebarons, conceived by people as either freedom fighters or oppressors.

## GRD
Guards of the castle, protectors of the camp, the mafia's thugs, rude and brutal fighters, reinforcing order, managing convoys, distributing the goods, running the arena; criminals playing the wardens, often abusing their power.

## STT
Eyes and ears of the barons, informants and agents, hiding in the crowd: Snitches, Spies, Thieves, Dealers and Assassins for all undercover operations of the Mafia, <!--operating from a secret headquarter,--> creating a web of mutual distrust among the people for control.

## KDF
High priests of Innos, powerful mages of fire, selected by the king for the creation of the barrier; idiosyncratic individuals trapped together in the prison they created, <!--based in the former chapel,--> partaking in and corrupted by the wealth of the barons while operating as agents of the crown.

## VLK
Inhabitants of the camp under control of the Mafia; conglomerate of convicts from all stands of society; mostly servants and craftsmen, who are not working in the mines, practicing their former professions or otherwise trying to survive as beggars on the streets.

## KDW
Priests of Adanos, great masters of healing, broke with the circle of fire in dispute about the barrier, decided that it needs to be eradicated [by magical destruction], opposing the interests of the king; founding the new camp in a pact with Commander Lee in shared leadership, thus becoming renegades in the eyes of the crown.

## SLD
Mercenaries of the mages, former Gladiators in the Old Camp who gained their freedom in the revolt; now wearing parts of their gladiator armours as proud signs of their struggle. Haters of the king and the barons who support his cause with their ore business.
