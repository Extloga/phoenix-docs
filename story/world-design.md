# World

At first we will deal with the design of the levels of Act I, everything within the Colony before the fall of the barrier, divided into Overworld and Underworld design. Then we will deal with the levels of Act II, which contains the colony as it changed after the fall of the barrier, with the design of the city and its surroundings as a small explorable section of the outside world. 

Then we will analyse the evolution of the different factions ("guilds") in the world and what to make of them. <!--, then with the NPCs and their initial placement ("start routine") in the world (the "setup" that the player will be confronted with).--> 

And finally we will deal with the placement of objects (non-takeable, static objects, moveable or useable objects as well as takeable objects, items).

Leveldesign

After the analyses of the abstract level structure and the evolution of the map, alongside the layout of the main level, that contains all the camps (the *surface*) - we will now "meta-analyse" the development of individual level sections in comparison. We look at specific sections of the world both in isolation and in relation to other relevant level sections in order to draw conclusions for the level design in PHOENIX. 

The terrain of the surface and the position of camps, the design of the camps (and the city) themselves and the design of the "dungeons" or everything below the surface. 

We will make some words about the climate within the colony and the outside world as well as about vegetation and the placement of plants (conditions necessary for growth). We will deal with the placement of monsters (or animals) and orcs in the world. 



### Removed or unrealised Locations

* Rune Temple
* Island 
* Lighttower
* Half-Orcs in the forest
* Mage's Camp


Fogtower/Lighttower:
Where would a lighthouse (in German "Leuchtturm", *lighttower*) be more fitting than here, hovering above the sea, close to the beach with the wreck? And what has the fogtower to do here, far away from the borders of the swamp and the fog of the area? 


### The Barrier, its Size and the Centre of the World

The size of the gameworld was never changed significantly. But in the world model of v0.5-0.6 the world reached further north and further south. In 0.7 onwards it was reduced in size towards the north and the south, but increased towards the east and west. In a result of this change of the world model and the necessary borders of the world, the barrier was changed in its proportions to have more of a squished, oval shape instead of being a perfect sphere as it was originally meant to be. 

The Old Camp was always positioned right in the centre of the game world (point 0, at the crossing point of the global X and Y axes). This has never been changed. Only due to the reduction in size of the south and the north of the world in later versions, the barrier's scale had to be reduced alongside and it was squished into an oval shape (originally it was supposed to be a perfect sphere). 

While the Old Camp itself has never been moved, this later change of the barrier's extent put it slightly off the centre, if the barrier is seen as the border of the gameworld that it is. In any way, it was the Old Camp, originally called "Midcity", that was drawn first and that was always meant to be in the centre of the game world. 

It is a fact, that according to the original concept, the Sleeper was supposed to be under the Old Camp, he was conceived as sleeping at the very bottom of the barrier or very close to it, at the "foot" of the barrier, deep below the Old Camp as the centre of the barrier. 
{: .subtext}

**PHOENIX:** If there is anything to change here, it would be to restore the additional space in the north and the south, to transform the barrier into a perfect sphere and make the Old Camp the centre of the barrier again. 


### Free Camp & New Camp

The specifics of the design of the camps themselves are dealt with in the corresponding documents, here we will only talk about their position. 
{: .subtext}

During the Orpheus phase the New Camp was always shown in the southwest. It happened during the involvement of Ralf, during the restart of the project under its new working title "Phoenix" that it switched its place with the Free Camp and was modeled in the northwest. The connection of the New Camp with the peasants on the fields at the foot of the "Old Castle" in the south was prevalent in the Orpheus phase and in Alex Wittmann's story, but was soon developed further into the idea of the rice terraces, which was crucial to give the Camp its design both on Ralfs concepts and in form of the ingame models of the camp. We do not have any concept of the New Camp as Mike imagined it to be and we assume that there was none. The cooperation with Ralf has given the Camp its character (through several iterations), but the rice terraces and the dam and thus the waterfall and the connection with the river were the one thing, that all the concepts had in common, based on Mikes own sketch that he made at some point after the Orpheus Map V1. 

At this point it did not really make any difference for the New Camp neither for the setting, nor the story nor stylistically or in any other way, that it was moved further up towards the northwest and basically switched places with the Free Camp. But it did make a difference for the Free Camp at least in so far that the Free Mine was always supposed to have a connecton to the Abandoned Mine. Moving the Free Mine much further into the south (and simultaneously the Abandoned Mine further north and further east) of course did not mean that such a connection could not anymore exist, but if so it had to be different than what was imagined originally. According to the story documents this connection does not seem to have been given up alongside these changes of the layout. And it doesn't have to be. 

Apart from that, we do not know any world model in which the world was modeled according to the former layout, the New Camp was in the northwest and the Free Camp in the southwest in the earliest world models we are aware of. It is this layout that the players knew from all existing demos and screenshots before release. Therefore we do not see a reason to change this. But the positional change of the Free Mine cannot be seen independent from the positional change of the Old Mine. 


### Old Mine 








PUT TO OLD CAMP

The Old Camp was supposed to be situated higher than it was in the end, at least when looked at it from the north. This image gives a good overview on that: 

https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/mikehoge/locations/path-to-city.png

[TODO: Add this section from below Cavalorns hut over the bridge until the orc arena etc., this entire section, into the bigger swamp, accessible perhaps only in Act II in a mixture of G1 and what G2 did there with the swamp dragon]










to World Design
## Stone Cirlce and Rune Temple

We have to say that we do not know any concept by Ralf of the stone circle in particular as Mike had imagined it. That does not mean that there may not exist one that we do not know of, but it is very unlikely. Because for the first time with Ralfs concepts the idea of the "island of resurrection" appeared. It is described as "Place of Ressurection" (Erweckungsplatz) and as an "Old Rune Temple" ("Der Alte Runentempel"). Ralf was inspired by the island of the dead by Arnold BÃ¶cklin. We know from the design documents that the Stone Circle was a place of resurrection. The player himself was supposed to be resurrected here when he dies, as well as other players in the multiplayer. Thus, the most likely explanation is that this rune temple was Ralfs re-imagination of the Stone Circle. But the problem is that we have no idea where it was supposed to be. It was located on a small lake. The concept suggests it being close to a waterfall. It is surrounded by high mountain walls and it looks very hidden. One possible location would be somewhere underground. One possible location would be the "hidden" lake close to the Demontower. There is one thing that may seem confusing in this regard. In the Phoenix Main Mission doc it is mentioned:

> OW: AM-Eingang Ã¼berschwemmt. Seespiegel sinkt - Insel zugÃ¤nglich.
> "Surface: Old Mine Entrance flooded. The lake water level decreased - Island accessible. 

But this is not so strange if you keep in mind that this still has to be based on the old world layout with the Old Mine in the south, close to this lake below the demontower. It cannot be based on the later layout; where there is no lake close to the mine. The closest would be the lake of the New Camp, but this is still far away and how would that entrance be flooded, that leads upwards instead of downwards as the original mine in the south? That means: When the old mine collapses in course of the final prayer of the sect, parts of the lake at the surface are flooding the mine; the water in the lake is thereby significantly reduced and reveals the island of resurrection. 

In the phoenix leveldesign document "Der groÃe See und die Insel" ("the big lake and the island") is mentioned as a location. It does not make sense for this to be the lake at the New Camp either. It wouldn't be mentioned in this kind of way. Thus, we can very safely assume it to refer to the lake below the tower. Other than that, the location is following immediately after the demontower in the document structure. 

That means that this design was approved and even considered for the story already. And there has to be a reason why it didn't make it into the game in the end. A very obvious one may be the technical difficulties of realising the idea. Letting the water level sink, letting the entrance of the mine be shown as actually being flooded; it was not possible to do without loading an entirely new surface level. 








### Add to World Design: "Northern Environment"

The player would arrive here:

![Beginning of the Game in Ralfs Concepts](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V1_1.jpg)

He would walk through the hole in the mountain wall, over the tree alongside a waterfall, from where he would have a short sceneric view towards the Old Camp. Through a hole in the mountain wall again he would enter the lift, leading 80m down.

![Towards the Lift](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Oberwelt_Anfang-V1-2.jpg)

The lift would bring him into this area, where he could take a passage way towards the valley or another path leading to the Abandoned Mine. A path which through the placement of the rocks - which are hiding the passage to the valley from the perspective of the player when he arrives - would have been most likely for the player to take first. While when coming back from the mine, looking into the other direction, the path to the valley would become more obvious to him. Whatever path the player would take, he would leave them to arrive here at the "northern environment": 

![North of the Valley](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Abschnitt_A1-A2-B1-B2.jpg)

It should be obvious how these concepts deviated from Mikes conception. And if you look at the first picture above, you will see how Mike has added sketches to Ralfs concept to show him how he wants it to be. It was an usual process for him to draw over Ralfs concepts as a form of feedback. That said - he did not really approve of this particular sketch due to how much it changed his idea. 

You also have to note how Ralf didn't include any incline (such as Mike had done on his map, where the area was supposed to lead upwards to the exchange place, as it was later realised in the game). Instead of having any of organic inclinations, Ralf he has drawn rather strict straight paths, first horizontal, then a vertical path downwards in form of the lift and again a strict horizontal path to the valley. 








### Size of the Barrier

As mentioned above, the size of the barrier was defined by Mike as 1 km in diameter in his Orpheus Map V1. This was in 1996. In an interview with gagames.com from 20.06.1998 he still had the very same definition: 

> The place is a magic sphere, 1 kilometer in diameter, its lower half stuck in the earth. Inside is a prison mine colony, its convicts entrapped forever, because something has gone wrong during the casting of the magic barrier. (Mike Hoge)




#### The Swamp in the east

He cannot explore it as long as the barrier is intact. Making it a huge mysterious area that the player cannot reach, just look inside from afar, wondering what may there behind the barrier and how far it may lead him. 



#### Exchange Place and Cliff of the Damned

What was also clear from the start, was that the Exchange Place, originally called Marketplace, was imagined to be directly in the north. But while on the very first map sketch by Mike, titled "Orpheus Overview", the cliff was also directly north of the marketplace, with a lake below the cliff, this has been changed in Mikes much more elaborated "Orpheus Overview Map V1". While the marketplace stayed in the very north, the "Cliff of the Damned", as it was called, was not directly north of the marketplace anymore, but east of it. And the water into which the player was supposed to fall from the cliff, which has been drawn as a lake before, was now directly connected with the ocean; it was still between the marketplace and the cliff, but now, like the cliff itself, it was east of the marketplace. And the player was not supposed to swim towards the marketplace, but towards the so called northern forest, from which a way would lead him to the abandoned mine south of the marketplace. Alex Wittmanns Story "Sleeper's Ban" was written with this map layout in mind and the Gothic Comic has also being made in accordance with this idea.

[Include image section of the place from the map]


### Rivers and Camp Positions

In Mikes "Orpheus Overview Map V1", there was only one river flowing south of the Old Camp, from the southwest into the east, into the ocean in the eastern middle of the map. 

[include image]

In his next, untitled map sketch, he added a second river north of the Old Camp, flowing from the northwest straight to the northeast into the ocean. 

[include image]

In all the builds of the game, as early as v0.56c, it was this river who originated in the waterfall at the New Camp. But in Mikes original concepts, it was the first river in the south that would be connected with the New Camp. In all three of Mike's early map sketches, the New Camp was drawn in the southwest and the Free Mine was drawn in the northwest. 

[include images]

But this was changed early on for unknown reasons. Thus on the concepts by Ralf and also in the earliest world models we know of, it was already reversed. The New Camp was from now on in the northwest, and the Free Mine in the southwest. And it was not a mere cosmetic change. 

[include reconstructed map showing this]

According to the earlier concept, the New Camp was always supposed to be close to the Old Fort; at first there were supposed to be fields at the bottom of the Fort with peasants who would work for the Lord (later General Lee) of the New Camp. And the Fort was meant to be close to the barrier, very far southwest, not as close to the Old Camp. 

[include image of the Fort position]

A river was flowing through the middle of the fields and this river was ending in the ocean east of the Old Camp, with the Psi Camp being directly in the ocean there in the east.

[include image with the river and ocean blue]

In Mikes third map sketch the former fields at the foot of the Old Fort have changed to be rice terraces at the foot of the New Camp, but they were still north of the Old Fort, from which you could look down upon them. The water from the terraces would already lead to a waterfall, which would form a small lake and then flow further, again into where the Psi Camp was supposed to be. But originally, as hinted at above, the Psi Camp was situated in the ocean; it had nothing to do with a swamp. But now the swamp was introduced, in Mikes third map sketch. He decided to disconnect the ocean from this new idea of the swamp, drawing a long coast line in the east, north of the Psi Camp. 


To summarise:

At first there was only one river in the world in the south of the Old Camp which was supposed to be close to the Old Fort and relatively close to the New Camp, with fields between the New Camp and the Fort. Then a second river was added in the north without any direct connection to a camp. The lake in the south was then conceptualised not only as being close to the New Camp, but as coming from a waterfall from within the camp, in which a dam was build that would water the rice terraces which replaced the former idea of the fields. Next the position of the camp was changed from southwest to northwest and the New Camp was from now on thought to be connected with the northern instead of the southern river. It was modeled in connection with the northern river in all versions of the game we know of. 

Then the shape of the southern river was changed, as it had lost its function of being related with watering the fields. It would no longer run from the left (southwest) to the right (southeast), but rather from the middle of the south to the middle of the east. Under the waterfall it came from there was drawn a lake (with a second, more hidden lake connected to it), underneath the cliff, where the Demontower was thought to be. This shape was roughly kept till release, but additional complexity was added by splitting it to form two rivers running along both sides of the Great Forest in the east.  


### Ralfs Map Concepts

Then when the project was resurrected under the working title "Phoenix" it was Ralf who developed the map further in cooperation with Mike. In this phase, several things were changed.




## Level Changes during Production

The Troll Canyon found its way into the game very early on, as seen in v0.56c.


What we also have to take into account is the Leveldesign document created in 03.11.1998 and changed last in 20.07.1999. At this point of the concept, the following locations were planned at the surface (we list them under the original names used in the documents and in their order):

* Troll Canyon
* Monastery Ruins
* Orc Graveyard
* Mountain Fortress

### Psi Camp 

[image of Mikes early psi camp]

Initially, the Psi Camp was situated in the ocean, described as a "Pfahlstadt" (pile city), all build on piles in the ocean, close to a mountain range that stretched all the way from the South to the east and in the centre of which was the Demontower (an area that was described as "the Cliffs in the Southeast"). 

When Ralf started to draw his concepts for the Psi Camp, it was already based on the idea of a swamp, as shown on Mikes Map v3. Instead of just being build on platforms in the ocean it was now supposed to be situated in a dark swamp, everywhere surrounded by huge trees, higher than the player would be able to see. 

[Include image]
First it was just a small wooden temple among the trees, connected to the holy stone with a statue of the enlightened with the third eye on his forehead hewn from the stone. 

Hence the name "Sect Temple" that the developers always used as a description of the whole camp, not as a description of a mere building within the camp, since everyone was in the "temple". The actual temple-like building was just the "sanctum", the holiest place of the temple, but the entire camp was conceptualised as this "temple" of the sect. They kept using this term throughout all the different concept phases of the camp until the new term "Psi Camp" came up at some point. 
{: .subtext}

[include image]
Then a bigger wooden fortress around a tree was drawn, with a smaller holy stone. Now with a sleeper idol instead of the Enlightened, also with the third eye on his forehead. A seperate building was added behind the stone, which would later be described as the "Sanctum" ("das Allerheiligste"). 

[include image]
Finally it was developed into seperated little islands instead of it all being one wooden temple complex; the holy stone remained, but was even more simplified; no statue or idol anymore, only the eye as the sign of awakening. The building behind the stone was kept as an idea and was developed further into the [Sanctum]() with a [Crypta]() underneath.
