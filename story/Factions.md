# Factions

**Author:** Flosha

By factions we mean groups of guilds within and across camps; or in short: Factions are cross-camp groups of guilds. I introduced them to simplify the complex "guild attitudes" by working with _layers of relations_ from general to specific (see [Relations]()). 

More than that, the factions serve dramaturgical functions (DraFu):

* Folk (Diggers, Workers, Beggars, Aux, ...)
* Mafia (Orebarons, Baron's Mercs, Shadows)
* Priests (Firemages, Watermages)
* Royals (Royal Family, Paladins, Royal Guard)
* Law (Magistrates, Inquisitors, Black Guard)
* Outlaws (Gladiators, Orgas, Bandits, ...)
* Revolt (Silence, Scraper's Union, Rangers)
* Heretics (Sects, Amazons, Evocators, ...)
* Slaves (Peasants, Women, Orcs, Demons, ...)
* Pariahs (Possessed, Halforcs, ...)

[Vlk] Volk (Folk)
[Maf] Mafia (Mafia)
[Prs] Priester (Priests)
[Kng] Königliche (Royals)
[Rch] Richter (Judges/Law) 
[Vgf] Vogelfreie (Outlaws)
[Fre] Freie (Freedom/Revolt)
[Ktz] Ketzer (Heretics)
[Slv] Sklaven (Slaves)
[Prh] Pariahs (Pariahs)


## Examples

Past LastPrayer Psi is split into Moderates & Fanatics (Mad).  
In Nemesis, the remnants of Psi form the Mystics (Psi → Mys).
While the outlasting Fanatics form the DemonCult (Mad → Dmc).
They are all considered as Heretics by Law, Royals & Priests.
