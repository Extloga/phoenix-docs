## Guild Ranks

In "Join Conditions" I have pointed out how in the early conception phase there was the idea of a level system within a guild and suggested that it corresponded to ranks within the guild and that it was also most likely linked to some degree to the chapters. 

I also made the example that a thug of level 5 may be thrown out of the guild, then join the sect and be a novice of level 1. By this example I suggested that these levels were linked to the guild and would not persist when joining a different guild and in this case this may be true. But a more precise and perhaps more logical explanation would be to assume that the level is primarily linked to the class. 
It may be possible to join a totally different class throughout the story, if one has no other option. But usually, as in the example of the shadow: a thief will defect to another thief guild from another camp. As we know, he can be up to level 5; thus having reached quite a high rank in his guild already and alongside having reached quite some skill as a thief. Therefore I assume that in such a case the level would indeed persist and would carry-over to an equivalent or similar rank in the new guild he defects to.

As far as we know, up to 7 maximum levels were planned per guild. If that is the case, how may they relate to the chapters, which were 6? In order to clarify this, we first have to point out that the player was meant to start not with level 1, but with level 0 (as being guildless and of no rank or name whatsoever inside of the prison system). 
Additionally, the 7 levels are linked to the 8-9 guilds that the player could join within the first chapter, but he would not belong to one of these guilds till the end of the game. Somewhere at the end of the game (I assume probably in chapter 5) he would join one of the four so called "higher", "secret" guilds. 

It is unlikely that these higher guilds were also supposed to have 7 levels that the player would progress through; not only due to their narrative meaning, where you are already of a high rank just by belonging to one of these elite groups, but also due to time within the story, where the player focuses on solving the game. It does not seem plausible to me that he was supposed to go through 7 different ranks within the two final chapters. And at least in the Guild System documents it is indeed the case that the 7 levels are only ever mentioned in regard to the regular guilds, not the higher ones. We simply don't know how much they were meant to have. 

A conclusion that stands to reason would be to choose the same number as the attribute levels, which are 10 (or 0 + 9). In this case, examplatory guild ranks throughout the story could roughly look like this:


```
+-----+------------+     +---------+
| Lvl | Rank       |     | Chapter |
|-----|------------|     |---------|
|  0  | Noname     |     |    1    |
|  1  | Initiate   |     |         |
|  2  | Novice     |     |    2    |
|  3  | Apprentice |     |         |
|  4  | Adept      |     |    3    |
|  5  | Alchemist  |     |         |
|  6  | Mage       |     |    4    |
|  7  | Naster     |     |         |
+-----+------------+     |    5    |
|  8  | Disciple   |     |         |
|  9  | Witcher    |     |    6    |
+-----+------------+     +---------+

```

Ingame, these ranks would be displayed or described as:

* Eingeweihter (kreisübergreifend)
* Novize des Feuers / Wassers
* Lehrling von X (Corristo/Saturas)
* Adept des Feuers / Wassers
* Feueralchemist / Wasseralchemist
* Feuermagier / Wassermagier
* Meister des Feuers / Wassers
* Schüler der Dunklen Künste / Schüler des DmB
* Dunkler Hexer / Dämonenbeschwörer


TO story and costume design:
Milten may have been a "Lehrling" in the Comic,
but since the game he may have become an "Adept".
Or he may become one in course of the game;
him being entrapped may even have to do with his task.
Maybe him becoming an adept and you becoming a novice
or an apprentice may be somehow linked even. 
For example, a "Lehrling" may have some responsibility
for a novice; so he serves you and you serve him. 
But when he becomes an adept he cares more about his studies
and you become an apprentice of Corristo yourself.
---
In that case we can look at the Comic robe as an apprentice robe.
Specific characteristics are: The leather parts are brown, not black.
An initiate may not have any kind of clothing, or maybe just a skirt.
A Novice may have the beggar-like skirt + the novice poncho from G2.
An apprentice may have the brown sash, as if to suggest that it is
not yet "burned" by fire, which makes it black, and he has not any
adornments on his robe yet (so no flames etc. at the bottom). No amulet.

As an adept the sash is fully black (Miltens ingame robe) and first
adornments (flames at the bottom and arms) are added + the amulet. 

As a fire alchemist then, you get additional adornments and the
colours may turn around. 
As a novice and apprentice you wore a red robe + dark/black sash. 
Now, Drago wears the opposite: Black/brown robe and red sash. 
Same as the general high firerobe, which the "firemage" may wear.
Then Corristo is wearing a fully red robe again. 
Which would be the one of a master of fire. 

We can follow this scheme and design the robes individuality
around these principles; apart from these colours etc. we are
free to use different adornment, runes, belts, amulets, shapes
of the sash, material etc. Just the colour is roughly defined. 





The ranks cannot really be divided equally throughout the chapters (for this we would need to have just 6 total levels or 12; which we have no reason to imagine), *unless* we do not think of the chapters as 6, but as 5 chapters, as described in the Phoenix Pitch.

If we assume 5 chapters, the guild progression would roughly be 2 levels per chapter. And it could very well be that this whole "10" levels idea for every attribute and other statistics from the alpha was first developed with the 5 chapters in mind. But even if so, the guild ranks do not necessarily have to be spread out evenly over the chapters. The progression through the guilds has to happen alongside the progression through the main story, but not necessarily in a fully symmetrical and fixed kind of way.
