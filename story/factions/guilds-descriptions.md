## ORPHEUS

### (OC)

#### Orebarons (EBR)
Conspired leaders of the Revolt, united by the torture they suffered, constituting a Mafia ruling the ore business, conceiving themselves as revolutionary successors of the tymorian orebarons, conceived by people as either freedom fighters or oppressors.

#### Guard (GRD)
Guards of the castle, protectors of the camp, the mafia's thugs, rude and brutal fighters, reinforcing order, managing convoys, distributing the goods, running the arena; criminals playing the wardens, often abusing their power.

#### Shadows (STT)
Eyes and ears of the barons, informants and agents, hiding in the crowd: Snitches, Spies, Thieves, Dealers and Assassins for all undercover operations of the Mafia, <!--operating from a secret headquarter,--> creating a web of mutual distrust among the people for control.

#### Circle of Fire (KDF)
High priests of Innos, powerful mages of fire, selected by the king for the creation of the barrier; idiosyncratic individuals trapped together in the prison they created, <!--based in the former chapel,--> partaking in and corrupted by the wealth of the barons while operating as agents of the crown.

#### Folk (VLK)
Inhabitants of the camp under control of the Mafia; conglomerate of convicts from all stands of society; mostly servants and craftsmen, who are not working in the mines, practicing their former professions or otherwise trying to survive as beggars on the streets.

#### Diggers (BDL)
Miners of the Old Camp under the rule of the Mafia, protected and oppressed by the Guard and under close surveillance of the shadows, they mine the ore for the deal with the king, keeping the exchange with the outside world going to get their little share. 


### (NC)

#### Circle of Water (KDW)
Priests of Adanos, great masters of healing, broke with the circle of fire in dispute about the barrier and decided that it needs to be destroyed, opposing the interests of the king; founding the new camp in a pact with Commander Lee in shared leadership, thus becoming renegades in the eyes of the crown.

#### Mercenaries (SLD)
Mercenaries of the mages, former Gladiators in the Prison Castle who gained their freedom in the revolt; now wearing parts of their gladiator armours as proud signs of their struggle. Haters of the king and the barons who support his cause with their ore business. 

#### Organisers (ORG)
Gang with single leader, corsairs of the mages, organising the camps daily life and stealing ore for the escape plan, link between all guilds of the camp, they set scouts, messengers, robbers and assassins, perceived by mafia as "ore pirates".
           
#### Peasants (BAU)
...  


### (FC)
     
#### Scraper's Union (SFB)
Union without masters conceiving their camp as the most free place in the colony, considered as traitors by the Mafia they fled. Allied with the New Camp and the Sect, yet serving their own interests; united by the work for a common purpose.
