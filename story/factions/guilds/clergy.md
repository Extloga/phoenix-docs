## Introduction 

Monks are religious ascetics living in a monastery or serving in a local temple. 

Mages are (in regular cases) former monks being initiated into some of the [magic arts](). Every initiated mage - at least formally - is also a priest in the ancient, not so much in the christian sense. But not every mage is actively involved in religious service in the temples of the realm. 

Many mages are completely focused on their magic art(s) under the grace of a lord which they serve as healers, battlemages, even as illusionists for entertainment at the court, or as scientists/alchemists. Those mages are often very famous and wealthy.

Other mages are living in monasteries among the monks they were once belonging to, some in an ascetic lifestyle, some less so. 

ToDo: More specific stuff like archmages, the rank of those mages who created the colony, the royal mages accompanying Rhobar and so on.


## Monks 

* Monks are religious ascetics living in a monastery or serving in a local temple.
* Some of them have the honour to receive initiation into the magic arts and are on the way to priesthood.
* Others start to study religious law and may later try to join the order of the inquisition.
* ToDo: Develop different ranks/titles.

### Attire

* Before ordination a new monk is clad in a naturally coloured linnen tunic (reaching to the middle of the calves) that remains his undergarment.
* Upon full ordination he receives a simple, long hooded robe (such as the 0.56c Alpha Mage Robe or the robes seen in the intro to THIEF) with no adornment
* The colour of the robe varies from order to order and region to region, and in some cases it is different within a single order simply due to availability of the material. It can be a dark, washed-out green (see medieval east-european monks), brown (see medieval western monks), red (for fire orders, such as the woolen robe that Milten wears under his leather sash) or blue (for water orders). 

> _Let clothing be given to the brethren according to the nature of the place in which they dwell and its climate._
> _(…)_ _The monks should not complain about the color or the coarseness of any of these things, but be content with what can be found in the district where they live and can be purchased cheaply._ (Benedictine Order)

### Equipment

* Linnen undergarment (3/4 tunic)
* Long woolen tunic of varied colour
* Cowl (hooded wrap covering most of the tunic like medieval benedictians or medieval eastern robes; in case of the monks of Khorinis it is red)
* Sandals
* A simple belt over the long tunic, but under the cowl
* Needle and thread to fix their garment (robes show visible signs of repair)
* A knife for various tasks
* A sword or small halberd (sufi style) in case of the monks of Khorinis after the order took over the district, basically making it a "military" order that combines the ideals of monk- and knighthood.

> _(…) the Abbot should provide all the necessary articles: cowl, tunic, stockings, shoes, belt, knife, stylus, needle, handkerchief, writing tablets;_ (Benedictine Order)

## Mages

* Only a small percentage of monks are allowed to become priests and thus receive initiation into magic.

### Attire

* It is the sash that connotes said magical initiation (and to be in the process of becoming a priest, like Milten). 
* In difference to the simplistic uniform monk robes, the robes of mages are highly individualistic, sometimes using their former woolen monk robe as a basis (which is almost always the case for the renegade mages of Khorinis, emphasizing their explicitly ascetic nature) with a sash from leather (e.g. Milten), wool or jute, at other occasions (as is the case with some arch mages in the colony or the mages of the king) being made from silk and sashes adorned with golden threads, showing off their wealth and status
* Sashes are connoting the rank of a priest and his magical specialisation in form of the runes on the sash, which in case of the renegade order [a placeholder name] is air magic.
* All mage robes, but especially those of the renegade mages, are roughly based on the robes of higher ranked medieval east european monks
* Some mages have their hood up, others down and some wear additional hats

### Equipment

* Linnen undergarment
* Monks tunic of varied colour
* Mage Cowl and sash combined with runic inscriptions referring to air magic and the orders history and tradition
* Hat (just two mages, one with the hood up, one with the hood down)
* Sandals
* Simple Staff (just one or two mages)
* Misc: Runes, Potions, Ore powder
