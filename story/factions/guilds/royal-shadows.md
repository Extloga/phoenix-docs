# Royal Shadows

**Authors:** *Avallach, Flosha*

Avallach, 05.10.2023:  
* The shadows are secret spies of the king. No one knows who is one. 
* While the inquisition searches for heretics both among citizens and even among priests and the royal guard, the shadows search for traitors and conspiracies.
* They are absolutely secret. Before Rhobar II they were just a legend. And to this day only the king and the highest level royal guards know who is a shadow.
* They are a bit like the inquisition, but have nothing to do with the cult, religion, magic or demons, they're about spies, conspiracies, national safety etc.
* Just like cia and fbi are a bit of rivals stepping on each others toes even though they work for the same government, there may be a bit of rivalry in some overlapping investigations between inquisition and shadows.
