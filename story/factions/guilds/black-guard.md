* Anti-heretic "police"
* Mostly former soldiers of the army
* Recruited by the order of the Inquisition to which they pledge their absolute loyalty, they are commanded by inquisitors and serve as their bodyguard
* They are especially trained in fighting demons, mutants and protection against magic
* Based on the *Imperial Demonhunters* of the Sequel
* Wardens of the Asylum
* Groups of black guardsmen are sometimes seen on their own under the command of a commander, when doing regular jobs. But at more complex operations they are always accompanied by one or two Inquisitors and work under their command.


## Attire & Equipment

![Sequel Armour](/_img/factions/guilds/Demon-Hunter2.jpg)

* **Clothing:** Simple black/ashen tunic with brown leather seams stitched on top, dark pants, black or dark brown boots.  
* **Armour:** Some are just wearing haubergs, many are wearing combinations of brigandines from dark leather and a central scale armour (Sequel). Their arms and legs are always covered, often in combination with a sleeveless upper tunic in black with signs of the order. A few heavy soldiers are additionally wearing banded armour on top of the hauberg. 
* **Helmets:** They are wearing helmets made from a mixture of metal and leather-covered brigandines with a visor inspired by *Judge Death* (Sequel) 
* **Anonymity:** Not everyone is wearing a helmet and the helmets do not regularly cover the lower part of the face; therefore they are often wearing black scarves underneath (they do so always if not wearing a helmet), in order to keep a high degree of anonymity.  
* **Additional Protection:** They use shields with anti-magic protection, especially so when breaking into houses (like a special police unit walking behind the tall tower shield). When fighting primarily against demons they use a spike attachment on their helmets (Sequel); when expecting fights against (armed) humans they may remove this attachment; some of them use the same kind of spikes on their arm guards as protection both against demonic claws/bites as well as to deflect/control sword hits.
* **Weapons:** Their weapon of choice is the sword and they use crossbows, which may be among the most advanced crossbows in the realm.
