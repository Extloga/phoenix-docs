# Characters

*flosha, 29.09.2024*

Here we want to give an overview of all the characters of our gothic drama. We list all of their names in their german and their english form, structured in factions and guilds. Additional languages should be added in the future. 

"Characters" is the story-equivalent to "NPCs" in the game mechanics section. While in NPCs we have described how NPCs function internally in an abstract way, here they are in their concrete expression as characters in the game. 

After listening all the NPCs we offer an NPC short *description*, based on (1) what we know about them from all the sources and (2) what we can additionally derive via reflections about their names, be it by what their prison nicknames may tell about them, be it by what we find from an etymological perspective or be it by comparison with characters of the same name jn other media that they may have been inspired by. 

What we will not address here is how the characters will develop in course of the story; this is the topic of the "Character Plots", starting with the Character Progression.
