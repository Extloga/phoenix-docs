# Characters

*flosha, 29.09.2024*

Here we want to give an overview of all the characters of our gothic drama. We list all of their names in their german and their english form, structured in factions and guilds. Additional languages should be added in the future. 

"Characters" is the story-equivalent to "NPCs" in the game mechanics section. While in NPCs we have described how NPCs function internally in an abstract way, here they are in their concrete expression as characters in the game. 

After listening all the NPCs we offer an NPC short *description*, based on (1) what we know about them from all the sources and (2) what we can additionally derive via reflections about their names, be it by what their prison nicknames may tell about them, be it by what we find from an etymological perspective or be it by comparison with characters of the same name jn other media that they may have been inspired by. 

What we will not address here is how the characters will develop in course of the story; this is the topic of the "Character Plots", starting with the Character Progression. 


## Character Names

### Translation of Names

As explained in /mechanics/nicknames, many characters in the game are called by their nicknames that they were given in the prison. While this has always been planned to be so, the fact that these names *are* nicknames given by other inmates was never really addressed in the game. And while in other translations, such as the polish one, these nicknames were translated, in German they kept the English names they had used in their prototypes and demos. The result was that the majority of the german players didn't even think about them as nicknames. In this way a german player doesn't really sense a difference between e.g. such names like Gomez and Milten, to names like Snipes or Blade. But the first ones are actual names, while the last ones are prison nicknames. 

And especially german players, who cannot speak english, such as the most who played it as children, are of course unable to see much of a meaning behind the names and cannot see any association to the characteristics or the history etc. of a character. When playing the game with twelve I didn't even know that a scar was a "Narbe", so how would I have been able to associate his name with his face? 

*Scar* is also the Protagonist in STALKER Clear Sky, where it has obviously been translated to *Narbe*.

English names in a german game cannot convey the meaning of nicknames given by other inmates. Only by translating them into German (*Verdeutschung*) we can properly convey the idea. 

Another reason why we need to translate the names is that the player too was meant to receive different nicknames, that would change in course of the story according to his deeds or the rumours about him. But this can only be communicated in a believable way when this is also the case for other characters in the world. It is a general custom in the colony and we have to make this clear. 

The idea of a differentiation between "newbie names", given to rookies, to the "babies" of the colony (see the original "Welcome to the Colony, Baby") and the names of those, who have already made a name for themselves, will also be impossible to convey without a translation.   

Since the German version has been released with these names of the english version, players are accustomed to these names. To the german ear they are generally sounding "cooler" due to the vogueness of english and anglicisms. Replacing a name like "Raven" with "Rabe", for many players will sound strange and almost as if it is belittling the character. But long story short: We do not care. 

In a translation it may be fine if some of the meaning cannot fully be conveyed, but we are speaking of the german original here. So there is no question about it - the names have to be germanised. The same has to be done in every other language and lacking or suboptimal translations have to be improved. The translation doesn't have to be literal, but should be close to the desired meaning.
