# About


## Phoenix - A Gothic Tale

A dark fantasy drama, narrated like a greek tragedy in two acts.  
Developed by [PhoenixTales](https://phoenixtales.de), 

 With a unique aesthetics.  


and at the same time the reconstruction of the intial vision of GOTHIC (2001).  



## Phoenix - A Gothic (Alpha) Reboot

PHOENIX is based on and conceived as an independent and non-commercial Reboot of GOTHIC&trade; by Piranha Bytes. It is inspired by the original vision of GOTHIC of which only fragments have been realised. We see the game as it was primarily as a proof of concept of what it could have been - which is what we want PHOENIX to be. GOTHIC had *Phoenix* as its working title and thus we have chosen it as the name for this project under which we aspire to realise this initial vision with its radical potential.  

In course of the development of PHOENIX we have created the [Gothic Archive](https://gothicarchive.org) to preserve and to present this inherited vision that we are curating since. We have been provided diverse pre-release material such as design documents, concept arts and alpha builds that we provide to the public in return, insofar we're allowed to.  

All these ressources and the underlying design philosophy and artstyle is analysed in a collective effort of "alpha research" and developed further by us, consequently and without compromises, documented in our [Phoenix Concept]().

The Phoenix Design Concept (short the "Phoenix-Docs") is a comprehensive documentation of every aspect of the project and is presented here in digital form, where the index serves as the navigation. Since we target an international audience and are an international team the docs are written in english. We plan for a physical release of the docs when we're done.  

<p class="subtext">Note: *Everything* is work in progress. The docs are currently rewritten and will be unlocked over time. Plot documents will not be unlocked before release. Due to the current ongoing work on the order and internal structure of the documents regular changes to the Index are to be expected.</p>
