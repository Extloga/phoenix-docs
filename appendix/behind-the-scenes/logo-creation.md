# Logo Creation

**Author:** *Flosha*

Phoenix is promoted with different kind of imagery, namely three different graphics. We call them, the...

* Phoenix Logo
* Phoenix Mask &
* Phoenix/Nyx Sign

I have been asked about the motivation for creating these images and what the meaning behind them is, especially of the mask and the sign. 


## Phoenix Sign

I will begin with the sign, because it is the oldest of them all. We call it the Phoenix "sign", or the "Nyx logo".

When the project was started, we called it "Project Nyx". Phoenix was a term we knew that had some kind of relation to Gothic, but we assumed it was mostly related with the engine. We did not know yet that it served as a working title of the game itself after the Orpheus phase, when they founded Piranha Bytes (Orpheus was conceptualised before that, which is also the reason that PB and THQ have no rights on these concepts, they belong to Mike). 

With this working title, "Project Nyx", we had something that sounded dark enough, like Gothic and was at the same time a name from greek mythology, like Orpheus, Nemesis etc. (you may know the relation of these three from our FAQ). 

And now we had to get some kind of logo, a sign or a symbol. There is a specific tradition among retro games to have some kind of sign associated with them. For instance, Unreal Tournament is known very well by the "U" in their specific style that also serves as their "icon". Another well known example is the Half Life logo, the lambda by which everyone recognises the game. But to me the most iconic logo of them all is the sign of Quake.

I was inspired mostly by that and started to experiment with a logo for Nyx. Another inspiration for it was the sign here on the left. But I don't remember anymore where I have it from and what it means.

This was one of the first ideas, using the most "archaic" looking style of the early Gothic logo from the time when the letters did not yet have a "frame" as in the later designs.  
But this was just the "Y" of NYX. I also needed the N and X. My idea was to combine all the three letters in some form.  
In a transitional stage I made this below. This specific form of the "N" is a sign that Mike has always used in the context of fire mages for some reason.

But then I had the idea of this blood running through the sign and in a triangular shape and made this:

A more or less conscious inspiration for this may have been the sign from Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (another example for a very cool logo associated with a game), which is inspired by the Cuneiform - the oldest known writing system as used in Mesopotamia). There it was also blood running through the sign, but filling it completely, before the colours would be inverted to leave the sign to be an empty black:

But since I wanted to combine these three letters somehow, it evolved into this:

![1000050025](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64a52627-e2f8-416d-a0dd-439d429d5ba5)

* N and Y form the X. 
* The Y at the same time serves as a metaphor for the sceptre of varant, that plays an important role in the story. 
* Blood flows into the Y, open upwards, symbolism of sacrifice, like a sacrificial bowl (in this context blootearth clan, persecution of heretics, dark forms of magic, blood ore, war and all these important story related things) but if seen as an upward motion it can also be compared to a bud, in form of the triangle turned upside down, which is a symbol of the revolution and uprising. In this context I had made another version of the logo where instead of the blood running down, a flame is rising up from within the "Y"; and only now when thinking about it, I imagine that we could nicely combine these two approaches in an animation, where at first the blood is running downwards through the sign and then transforms into fire rising up -> the revolution (liberation from outside) and the phoenix (liberation from within) are nourished by suffering and blood).

ToDo: Add image/gif of this.

While at first it served primarily as a logo for the project and its working title "Nyx", over time the meaning became more and more profound and with more associations with older original ideas. 

One example is, that when designing the upside down triangle I had no idea that this very same symbol was a sign of the "RÃ¤cher" (Avengers), the templars of the brotherhood, as seen on the templar armor in 0.64b, which we did not have at the time of the sign's creation.

[add image of this texture]

This way what I originally conceived as a symbol for the more rebellious anti-king and anti-clerics faction in Act 2, which combines the mystics experimenting with the old ways of magic and psionics beyond the old constraints of the brotherhood (which includes a few of those former sect members who did not become insane, who accepted the "truth" about the demon but did not give up their fascination for the mystery of the psionic powers) with the rebellious thieves and spies who work against the crown, had now also an association with (a subgroup of) the former sect - quite fitting. 

In a similar way I also only realised much later that the shape of the Y I made in the sign is almost exactly corresponding to the spikes at the top of the original Demontower, which I reconstructed based on the original tower (which was later re-used by the level designers in form of the sunken tower) and the different concept arts. 

(screen of the tower model (top only))

These associations led to all kinds of explanations and lore (a meaning of the shape, function of the tower etc.) and thus, over time, the symbol became much more than a mere logo outside of the game. It has now lots of meaning even *inside* of the game, especially in association with the bloodearth clan (the Orcs who guard the sealed portal in fear of the awakening of the demon they summoned thousand years ago). Outside of the game, for promotion purposes, it is just an additional graphics we use to represent the project, but then the players will be able to discover this very sign within the game and slowly realise the different meanings behind it. 

The latest aspect we became aware of and I did not know when I designed it (Avallach pointed it out to me a few months ago), is that this red downward triangle was a sign during the Third Reich. It was an emblem used on the clothing of all prisoners that were brought into concentration camps for political reasons, such as anarchists. Which, for what we use it for as a symbol of the revolution, is just another very fitting coincidence.
