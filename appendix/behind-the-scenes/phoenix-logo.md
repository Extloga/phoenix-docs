I started to design the Phoenix logo immediately after I decided to name the project accordingly, which was when we realised that this was in fact the second working title of Gothic, as most prominently seen in the Phoenix Pitch.  

I decided to name the project this way and wanted to design a real "logo" now, I mean, a logo that actually displays the title and not an abstract sign. It was supposed to be based, style-wise, on the same archaic early gothic logo design as the Nyx sign. Obviously there is not as much of a story or meaning behind the design. But similar to the approach before (of seeking inspiration by iconic retro game symbols), I was now looking for iconic logos. 

And for me, the most iconic logo out there, which is very well known too, might be the one of "DooM".
