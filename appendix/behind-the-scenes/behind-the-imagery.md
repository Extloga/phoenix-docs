# Behind the Imagery

Namely the PhoenixTales Branding
The Phoenix Sign of Nyx
The Mask of the Prophetess
And the Phoenix Logo

In course of the years of development, I created different kinds of imagery for Phoenix as well as for our team, PhoenixTales. Namely four specific graphics, the *Phoenix Logo*, the *Phoenix Mask*, the *Phoenix Sign*, the *Phoenix Mascot* as we call the bird that is representing our team besides our team logo and our ASCII art. I have been asked about the motivation for creating this imagery and about the meaning behind the graphics, especially of the mask and the sign, which I have written about in five dedicated articles.
