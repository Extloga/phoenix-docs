# ToDo

Flosha:
* Simplify image styling by adding display:block and centering via margins to the style.css and out of the individual docs.
* Style the top article-info (authorship etc.) section in style.css via a pre tag styled as inline-block.
* Add a section like / parent dir / article with a link to the parent directory on mobile as a navigation to the bottom of each article with position: sticky, so that it sticks to the bottom and remaims visible until reaching the bottom where it should not overlapp with the footer. On desktop this will not look good, therefore have that same section at the top instead with no absolute position and no border, probably above or below h1. 
* Center the phoenix header in the mobile nav better.
