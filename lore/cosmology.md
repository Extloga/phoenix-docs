## Creation Myth

*Flosha, 13.06.2024*

> Vom Anbeginn der Zeit: Es ward noch kein Tag oder Nacht und kein Wesen zog über die Welt. Da erschien der Welt Innos und sein Licht erhellte alles. Und Innos schenkte der Welt das Leben. Da aber kein Wesen im Licht des Innos leben kann, schuf er die Sonne. Das Licht war aber noch zu stark. Da teilte sich Innos und schuf Beliar. Beliar brachte die Nacht. Nun konnten die Menschen sein. Da teilte sich Innos erneut und schuf Adanos. Adanos gab den Menschen die Vielseitigkeit, Wissen, Neugier und Mut. Innos war sehr zufrieden mit sich und seinem Werk. 
> Und er beschloss die Menschen Adanos ganz zu überlassen, um zu ruhen. [G] 

As the scripture is most likely written by a priest of Innos (see [/lore/gods](/lore/gods)), Ra does not appear as a name, but based on our analysis of the gods, we can as well imagine Ra as the creator god here instead. 

> "There was no day yet nor night and no being wandered on the world."

This is a wording that according to tradition seems to speak of a time before existence. 

> "There appeared Innos to the world and his light illuminated everything. And Innos gave life to the world."

Everything was one and everything was light, this was the beginning of the universe. 

> "But since no being could live in the light of Innos, he created the sun." 

This we can interpret to mean, that the light was bundled, focused, concentrated into a perceived center of the universe. 
 
> "But the light was still too strong. There Innos divided itself and created Beliar. Beliar brought the Night. Now Man could be." 

The underlying unity of existence had to create duality to enable reality, to enable realisation; nothing could realise the light without darkness; duality was a necessity for life. According to the lore, humans came only in existence after Beliar originated from Innos or Ra. 

So Beliar, formerly called *Vandras*, described as the "God of Darkness", "the dark God", originated or emanated from Ra as a necessity, as life could not be in the light of Ra without darkness, he "who brought the night"; it is due to him that man could be and realise god on earth/in himself, due to the God of justice and death, in the realm of the "Shadows" in which everyone ends.

> "There Innos divided himself again and created Adanos. Adanos gave men diversity, knowledge, curiosity and courage."

Adanos, also known as "Cyvanis" and "Adrastos", originated after Beliar from the same common source and can be interpreted as being associated with the evolution of humanity into the supreme species it considers itself to be; in that he gave man... 
* diversity (different tribes, cultures, nations)
* knowledge (the development of self-consciousness and intellect)
* curiosity (the driving force of exploration) and
* courage (to conquer and rule the world "given" to them)
