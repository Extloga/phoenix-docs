# Prison Names

## Translation of Names

As explained in /mechanics/nicknames, many characters in the game are called by their nicknames that they were given in the prison. While this has always been planned to be so, the fact that these names *are* nicknames given by other inmates was never really addressed in the game. And while in other translations, such as the polish one, these nicknames were translated, in German they kept the English names they had used in their prototypes and demos. The result was that the majority of the german players didn't even think about them as nicknames. A german player doesn't really sense a difference between such names as Gomez and Milten, to names like Snipes or Blade, whereas the first ones are actual names, while the last ones are prison nicknames. 

Especially german players who cannot speak English (such as almost everyone who played it as a child) are of course unable to see much of a meaning behind the names nor can he see an association to the characteristics or the history of a character. When playing the game with twelve I didn't know that "scar" means "Narbe", so how would I have been able to associate his name with his face? 

*Scar* is also the Protagonist in STALKER Clear Sky, where it obviously has been translated to *Narbe*.

English names in a German game cannot convey the meaning of nicknames given by other inmates. Only by translating them into German (*Verdeutschung*) we can properly convey the idea. 

Another reason why we need to translate the names is that the player too was meant to receive different nicknames, that would change in course of the story according to his deeds or the rumours about him. But this can only be communicated in a believable way when this is also the case for other characters in the world. It is a general custom in the colony and we have to make this clear. 

The idea of a differentiation between "newbie names", given to rookies, to the "babies" of the colony (see the original phrase: *"Welcome to the Colony, Baby"*) and the names of those who have already "made a name for themselves", will also be impossible to convey without a translation.   

Since the German version has been released with the names of the English version, players are accustomed to these names. To the german ear they are generally sounding "cooler" due to the vogueness of English and anglicisms. Replacing a name like "Raven" with "Rabe", for many players will sound strange and almost as if it is belittling the character. But long story short: We do not care. 

In a translation it may be fine if some of the meaning cannot fully be conveyed, but we are speaking of the german original here. So there is no question about it - the names have to be germanised. The same has to be done in every other language and lacking or suboptimal translations have to be improved. The translation doesn't have to be literal, but should be close to the desired meaning.  

The names and how we germanised them (or anglicised in the opposite case) are to be found in [/story/characters](/story/characters).


## Name Structure

Many inmates have nicknames and the Alpha documents apparently suggested it to be basically *all* of them. But several of them have none and this makes sense. 

For one, all (or almost all) of the mages are not participating in this tradition, they use their regular names (or clerical names if we assume that to be a factor, as we do) and are powerful enough to demand them to be used. 

The same can be said for several of the barons and other high level characters. If they are at the top of the prison hierarchy - or at least high enough - they can enforce this respect of being called by their real name. Especially in case of someone like Gomez, who may have had a name already outside of the prison, they might want to be called by their real name. While others, such as Raven and Scar, may consciously choose to completely get rid of their former identity and forget about their past. Their new name carries more meaning to them and evokes more respect by others than whatever they may have been called before in a life they do not miss. They may not only not ever be called by their real name, but it may also be unknown and they prefer to keep it like that.

The brotherhood usually doesn't use prison nicknames either. If someone had one before, he will receive a new name in the brotherhood. These names are often very short (e.g. see all the Templars with names comprised of not more than three letters) and just as the titles that they use (Y, Cor, Ka, Gor-Na, Gor, Baal) their names have a different style and sound to them, which we interpret as originating from the older language. 

Thus, only characters in the Old Camp, New Camp and Free Camp are using prison nicknames. 

In the documents there were supposed to be three kinds of prison nicknames:
