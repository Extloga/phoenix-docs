# Prison Names

## Translation of Names

As explained in /mechanics/nicknames, many characters in the game are called by their nicknames that they were given in the prison. While this has always been planned to be so, the fact that these names *are* nicknames given by other inmates was never really addressed in the game. And while in other translations, such as the polish one, these nicknames were translated, in German they kept the English names they had used in their prototypes and demos. The result was that the majority of the german players didn't even think about them as nicknames. A german player doesn't really sense a difference between such names as Gomez and Milten, to names like Snipes or Blade, whereas the first ones are actual names, while the last ones are prison nicknames. 

Especially german players who cannot speak English (such as almost everyone who played it as a child) are of course unable to see much of a meaning behind the names nor can he see an association to the characteristics or the history of a character. When playing the game with twelve I didn't know that a scar was a "Narbe", so how would I have been able to associate his name with his face? 

*Scar* is also the Protagonist in STALKER Clear Sky, where it obviously has been translated to *Narbe*.

English names in a German game cannot convey the meaning of nicknames given by other inmates. Only by translating them into German (*Verdeutschung*) we can properly convey the idea. 

Another reason why we need to translate the names is that the player too was meant to receive different nicknames, that would change in course of the story according to his deeds or the rumours about him. But this can only be communicated in a believable way when this is also the case for other characters in the world. It is a general custom in the colony and we have to make this clear. 

The idea of a differentiation between "newbie names", given to rookies, to the "babies" of the colony (see the original phrase: *"Welcome to the Colony, Baby"*) and the names of those, who have already made a name for themselves, will also be impossible to convey without a translation.   

Since the German version has been released with the names of the English version, players are accustomed to these names. To the german ear they are generally sounding "cooler" due to the vogueness of English and anglicisms. Replacing a name like "Raven" with "Rabe", for many players will sound strange and almost as if it is belittling the character. But long story short: We do not care. 

In a translation it may be fine if some of the meaning cannot fully be conveyed, but we are speaking of the german original here. So there is no question about it - the names have to be germanised. The same has to be done in every other language and lacking or suboptimal translations have to be improved. The translation doesn't have to be literal, but should be close to the desired meaning.  

The names and how we germanised them (or anglicised in the opposite case) are to be found in /story/characters.
