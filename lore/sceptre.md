# Sceptre of Varant


**Author:** *Flosha*

* The sceptre of Varant is an old artifact that is assumed to have been created in the First Realm, belonging to their priest king, with the ability to take control over the *spheres*.  

* In the older language the lance may be called *Korin-Ak-Ra*, the lance from Ra, god of the sun. 

* The holy Khorin may have found the sceptre in Varant, similar to the Holy Lance that was assumed to be found during a crusade, a few hundred years ago. 

* Rhobar I. received the lance from here, he may even have been crowned in Khorinis, at some time after the death of Khorin, as the order of fire supported him. 

* After the reign of Rhobar, during the interregnum following him, there was a plot against the then established governor of the capital of Myrtana, during which a monk salvaged the sceptre from falling into the hands of thieves and decided to hide it where Khorin had once brought it to and has since then been searched by various men. 

* The opposition of the renegade order against the crown receives thereby much more narrative depth: The sceptre has not been given to Rhobar II. deliberately; the priests of the order do not consider the king to be a legitimate bearer of the sceptre, do not accept his title as the "governor of the highest god Ra", claim it to belong into the hands of a *priest*, elected by God, and despise the royal mages that they consider as opportunistic servants of power betraying the gods.

* It was here in the catacombs of the temple of fire of Khorinis that it was discovered by the Inquisition which Rhobar II. had established when forcing his way into power and had ordered to find it. Thus he got hold of the sceptre. But the monks who had tried to hide it from the new regime and were not handing it over deliberately, were executed; the Order of Khorin since then is seeing them as martyrs and plans to break free of the royal control.
