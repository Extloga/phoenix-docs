In order to understand the clergy of Myrtana, the priesthood and the mages, we have to clarify, what the magic circles are actually meant to be and how they relate to priesthood. 

These questions have always been seen so far, as far as I know, as a conflict between the imagination of the Gothic founders, in particular between Mike Hoge and Stefan Nyul. While Mike always laid emphasis on the idea that the mages were operating in form of these seperated circles since a long time and seemed to suggest that e.g. the priesthood of Innos is identical to the circle of fire, Nyul always seemed to promote a different idea, that led to many misunderstandings. 

These misunderstandings become clear in the question of how the split of the mages in the colony occured. Nyul described the events as such, that the mages split after the creation of the barrier and seemed to suggest, that they were *one* circle before. He has written it as such in the dialogue with Saturas and he has also written a book in the Sequel that suggested the same (see [/phoenix-allegory]).

There is one thing that we have overlooked so far.

The scriptures tell us about priests of Innos and Adanos. From the game we know a circle of fire and a circle of water. Two questions arise:

1. Are the priests and the mages clearly identified with each other? Are they the same? Or are they something different? Or something inbetween?
2. Couldn't the magic circle of the mages, even *if*, as we assume ourselves, the mages are indeed priests of Innos or Adanos, be seen as independent from their role as priests of a god? And can there be other priests, like Beliar priests, too?

The only thing in the sources that actually link these two, are the dialogues with Corristo, which we have to assume have been written in the last few months of development and we don't know by whom. Probably Mike. And it never really states so. It is only implied by Corristo having an obvious connection to the Cult of Innos. But being a mage that studies and practices specific forms of magic that are being associated with a god, doesn't have to equal being a priest of that god.

A priest of Innos for instance could join or learn from different magical circles. He becomes a priest in a monastery. Being a cleric may *usually* be seen as a pre-condition for a possible initiation into a magical circle, but there are exceptions too (such as Milten and the player character). 

---

Thus, it would actually be most reasonable, based on the sources, to say that: *Not* every mage is a priest. Not every priest is a mage. AND: Not every priest of Innos, who has been bestowed the "arcane gift", has necessarily to join the circle of fire. He may as well join the circle of air, for instance. 

Priesthood is something that spans across the entire realm. The "house of Innos" is their community as a whole, like the church. 

In comparison, I think that it would be a much better understanding of the magical circles to see them as a small, local community of mages who learn, study and practice magic together. In this sense, you would say that there may be douzens of circles in the realm.

The mages in the colony, most likely, did not even belong to the same magic circle; they were just commanded by the King to perform this ritual together, being among the most powerful mages and coming from different corners of the realm. And only due to them being imprisoned together they were now forming a circle on their own. 

But there might by as well another circle of fire in Khorinis, or another local circle of focused on a different element. A circle of air. Or a circle of earth. Most circles may have their own archmage oder leader; but there may even be circles without one; where a group of not yet fully mastered mages practice together in lack of a master mage. 
And there may be "laymen circles" too, which depending on what they are doing and practicing, may be illegal. 

I think that this understanding brings us much further and enriches the lore much more.

The circles are esoteric, while the priesthood is exoteric. In some cases they are strongly related to the gods, in other cases less so, and they have their own rules and traditions and rituals based on general old magic tradition. 

In this context we also should become aware of what this term "Arcane" usually means in the context of RPGs. So we *know* that according to the Gothic Alpha, based on the Attribute etc., the magic of the two circles was clearly bound to the *Arcane*.

In Dungeons & Dragons, so-called "Arcane Magic" is seen in total opposition to "Divine Magic". Divine magic is associated with clerics, while Arcane Magic is at the total opposite of the spectrum; it is practices often by those who despise the clergy, by occult circles and idiosyncratic individuals. 

> Arcane power at its heart is really in a way about hacking the multiverse. It's about taking a code and messing with the code around you. If you imagine the D&D multiverse and its magic, almost being like the matrix this world created by this magical code, arcane spellcasters are basically messing with it.

This division of Arcane Magic vs. Divine Magic was also used by Forgotten Realms, 


Origin of arcane magic: https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/84114/origin-of-arcane-magic

```
a number of societies from antiquity believed in forms of magic that were not strictly divine in nature. In particular, both the Classical Greek and Norse cultures had forms of magic that derived their power not from gods, but from "secret knowledge" of the working of the world -- the very definition of "arcane".
...
To the ancient Greeks, there was a clear distinction between religion (the worship of the gods) and magic (attempting to gain the powers of the gods). In many cases, the two were tied closely together; the popular practice of divination, for example, was seen as the gods speaking through an oracle. But it's clear, from the language if nothing else, that the Greek idea of "magic" matches very closely what we could call "magic" in modern English, separate and distinct from religious worship.
...
Since the Greek gods were an integral part of nature, it's difficult to separate them completely from magic, or any other aspect of Greek life. However, there is evidence in pre-Classical Greek writings of magical practitioners that studied the forces of the world around them (what they would have called the "sympathies") in order to control them. The gods were still usually present in these stories, but not as suppliers of magic, but suppliers of knowledge of magic.
...
Within Norse mythology, there is a form of magic known as Seidr, which was not powered by the gods, but by the forces of the spiritual world. In fact, in the Norse' minds, it was the other way around: the power of the gods like Odin and Frigga came from their use of magic -- the same kind of magic that mortals used. Of course, Odin was far more powerful than any human, but the women (it was mostly woman -- magic use was considered a primarily feminine pursuit) would gather together in large groups, often entire villages, to provide their spiritual essence to power magic.

The mages in the colony are no simple priests residing in the chapel. They are not even using it as a chapel. On the contrary, based on the design concepts the building has been a chapel before; when the wardens were still living in the castle there may have been a priest here and wardens and prisoners came here to pray or listen to preachings. But this is no longer the case. The mages have taken the chapel and actually desecrated it in order to use it as their residence and their laboratory. According to the concept arts, they have barricaded the windows to create a darker environment and remain undisturbed in their magical studies and practices by anyone outside. No one is allowed to enter the chapel, no one is going here to pray or sacrifice to the gods. Because the fire mages in the colony, are not acting as priests or at least not much, they are almost purely focused on the Arcane. 
Other fire mages may be priests and/or take this role more serious, they may preach and fulfill other cultic duties. But the circle of fire in the colony is not interested much in this regard. And based on our research, according to which we can assume that most of the convicts may primarily pray to Beliar, they have not much business doing so anyway.


In case of the colony, the mages may have been quite diverse, were working together for a while as a sort of united circle and then founded the two circles. Not in the sense of inventing the idea of a fire or water circle, of which there might be many in the realm, but just FORMING local ones in the colony. And therefore and due to this history they also may have some common traditions, as the mages of the colony, with some shared history. And they may have quite diverse specialisations.

The mages of a magic circle are literally mages around a magic circle drawn unto the floor to create a sacral/magical/ritual space.
The mages after the fall of the barrier where for some time studying together in the old camp, around ONE magic circle they had drawn in the old chapel that they haven taken over. It is in this sense, that Nyul and the Sequel story writers may be totally right: They were ONE circle before because this should be seen completely *independent* from their religous background. In this original circle of the colony, water, fire and also some dark magic was studied before they split over disputes, but the leaders of both circles are still disciples of the DMB.

Also a magic circle does not have to be linked to a specific element either. It is so with the colony mages, but there could as well be a magical circle that calls itself "Circle of Laran" or something like that and here study mages different forms of magic. Or there is a Zirkel around a specific Master X and thus called "the Circle of X".

The idea of the circles when interpreted in this way, is much more fitting to the gothic setting. Just compare this to all kinds of modern magical circles. 


Also, "Circle" may be a rare case where the term used in the english version serves the desired connotation better than the original german "Kreis". 

Kreis, while actually being identical in meaning, gives it just a bit less of a mysterious, esoteric feeling. It evokes the notion of an open "kreis" that anyone can visit, while actually a very "closed" circle ("geschlossener Kreis") is meant.
But in German "Zirkel" can be used just as well and in this context we should probably should use it more often. 






The *Arcane Gift* is bestowed upon the worthy, according to the priests of Innos, it must only be given to the *elected* ones. 

The Innos Cult calls it a *Spark* igniting the Fire.  
The Adanos Cult calls it the *Blessing of Water* in the game. 
The Beliar Cult may call it a *Kiss of the Night* or a similar metaphor.

## Alchemical Magic

Take date from discord story docs

The magic in Gothic is strongly linked with the four elements. The four elements (fire, water, air, earth) are mentioned in the book *Astronomy* [G] and one of the books of the circles is called *Elementare Arcanei*, which means as much as *Elementary Arcanum*. 

The magic spells in Gothic are also clearly referring to at least three of the elements. There are fire spells, water spells and air spells too; the latter are just not really assigned to any dedicated air focused mages circle. In the Alpha, spells like petrification existed, which would commonly be seen as earth spells.

The idea of four elemental mages may seem stereotyptical, but this is not really the case; on the contrary. The magic of the circles is "alchemical magic", they are described as alchemists. Alchemy deals with these (as well as other) elements and this lore would have given all kinds of opportunities to introduce additional "elements" in the successor and so additional circles of mages too. The other elements would then just not have been focused on in the first game (other than later in the original vision perhaps the introduction to the orcish "earthen" magic and the blood/necromantic magic of Xardas).

The mages in the colony are simply *focused* on water and fire and *perhaps* this has a reason too in the context of the creation of the barrier, that these mages were selected for the task: After all the barrier forms a dome that billows around like water in the sky (even more so in the alpha textures), with flashes of lightning going through it. A work of cooperation of the two circles.

In alchemy, the downward facing triangle is the symbol of Water and of Earth. In the story the water mages have become rebels and are joining forces with the orcs (earth), while the revolutionaries use the red/bloody downward facing triangle as their symbol to overcome the established rule. In the empire fire has the predominant role (and in alchemy fire is represented by the opposite, an upward facing triangle). 

In the architecture of sacral and official buildings the upward facing triangle is therefore used by me as a shape for windows etc.

There also is the idea of the "generalist" mage, who would learn from the different schools and learn all these different elements; this may be an idea of the past due to the conflicts between the schools, which the mystics kind of revive. The Phoenix mystery has to do with this and can be explained in allegorical alchemical terms.

> The modern categories roughly corresponding to the classical elements are the states of matter produced under different temperatures and pressures. Solid, liquid, gas, and plasma share many attributes with the corresponding classical elements of earth, water, air, and fire.

The "air" mages from Khorinis may mostly focus on this "gas" aspect.

The magic circles have to be seen (often) in association with, but not as being *identical* with the cults of the gods.

And mages may often be priests, but not always are.
