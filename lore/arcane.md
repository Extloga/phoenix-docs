# The Arcane


## Alchemical Magic

The magic in Gothic is strongly linked with the four elements. The four elements (fire, water, air, earth) are mentioned in the book *Astronomy* [G] and one of the books of the circles is called *Elementare Arcanei*, which means as much as *Elementary Arcanery*. 

The magic spells in Gothic are also clearly refering to at least three of the elements. There are fire spells, water spells and air spells too; the latter are just not really assigned to any dedicated air focused mages circle.

The idea of four elemental mages may seem stereotyptical, but this is not really the case; on the contrary: Since the magic of the circles is "alchemical magic", they are also described as alchemists. Alchemy deals with these elements and based on this it would make sense to introduce additional "elements" in the successor; the other elements were just not focused on in the first act (other than later in the original vision perhaps the introduction to the orcish "earthen" magic and the blood/necromantic magic of Xardas). 

The mages in the colony are simply focused on water and fire and *perhaps* this has a reason too in the context of the creation of the barrier, that these mages were selected for the task: After all the barrier forms a dome that billows around like water in the sky (even more so in the alpha textures), with flashes of lightning going through it. A work of cooperation of the two circles.

In alchemy, the downward facing triangle is the symbol of Water and of Earth. In the story the water mages have become rebels and are joining forces with the orcs (earth), while the revolutionaries use the red/bloody downward facing triangle as their symbol to overcome the established rule. In the empire fire has the predominant role (and in alchemy fire is represented by the opposite, an upward facing triangle). 

In the architecture of sacral and official buildings the upward facing triangle is therefore used by me as a shape for windows etc.

There also is the idea of the "generalist" mage, who would learn from the different schools and learn all these different elements; this may be idea of the past due to the conflicts between the schools, which the mystics kind of revive. The Phoenix mystery has to do with this and can be explained in allegorical alchemical terms.

> The modern categories roughly corresponding to the classical elements are the states of matter produced under different temperatures and pressures. Solid, liquid, gas, and plasma share many attributes with the corresponding classical elements of earth, water, air, and fire.

The "air" mages from Khorinis may mostly focus on this "gas" aspect.
