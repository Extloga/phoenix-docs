### Quotes

Here we'll quote all mentions/descriptions about the locations from the sources.

## Myrtana



#### Trantor

The Mad Scientists may have taken it from the "Foundation" series by Isaac Asimov:  
> Called forth to stand trial on Trantor for allegations of treason (for foreshadowing the decline of the Galactic Empire), Seldon explains that his science of psychohistory foresees many alternatives, all of which result in the Galactic Empire eventually falling. If humanity follows its current path, the Empire will fall and 30,000 years of turmoil will overcome humanity before a second empire arises. (Summary of Foundation)
Adjective: trantorian (*trantorianisch*)


## Analysis

Here we analyse, interpret and decide on what to do with the names given above: What will their role be in our drama?

---

### Northern Land(s)

Colder climate (ala Scandinavia). Home of the Huegoth from Sleeper's Ban, a barbaric tribe from the north raiding the coasts of the kingdom; redÂ hair, blue eyes, inspired by vikings. 

#### Land of the Shirtakkihn

Based on the home of the Shirtakkihn in *Sleeper's Ban*, described as warrior people from "the northernmost, polar regions"; have never been conquered by any nation; white hair, pitch-black eyes, blue clan tattoos.    
-> If the meaning of Shirtakkihn is clarified and included into our dictionary of the old language, we may be able to derive a name from that. 
* Shirtakkihn (plural)
* Shirtakk (singular)
* Shirtakkiha[?] (land)  

Kumatekk: polar badger; clan insignia of the most fearsome warrior clan of the Shirtakkihn -> that means there are some more Shirtakkihn clans. 


### The Far South

Home of the Nurrba, among others, mentioned in *Sleeper's Ban*: Barbaric tribe from the south; partially canibalistic; dark skin, colourfully dyed hair, e.g. green; all attempts to civilise them have been in vain -> probably inspired by specific African tribes.


### Western Provinces

Relevant here: Kasakk. Three-tailed deity, central deity worshipped by Tito from the western provinces. Those western provinces could be an area in Myrtana where they could not yet establish the three-god-cult thoroughly. Inquisition involved?


### Geronia

If South-Geronia exists, there also has to be North-Geronia or just Geronia in general. Geronia could be a land on its own, but it could as well be a region within Myrtana with a southern and a northern part.
