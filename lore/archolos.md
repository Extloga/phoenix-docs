# Archolos

Only mentioned once in an ingame text called "Rezepturen" (Band 2). Similar to other cases, Archolos was misunderstood by large parts of those who do not speak German, due to imprecise translations to other languages. 

The german text writes that the wine grows "an den Hängen des Archolos", which was translated to "at the slopes OF Archolos", which is not what the original says. This would have been a correct translation for "an den Hängen VON Archolos" and only in this case Archolos could be everything from a mountain to an entire province or even an island. But the german wording "des Archolos" is much more clear than that. A better translation to English would have been "of the Archolos". But even this would not have been as precise as the original text, as in difference to "des", "the" does not indicate a grammatical gender. 

"Des" is the Genitive Singular of "der" and "das". This means that Archolos can only be a location of neuter or masculine gender. Archolos could be the name of a Mountain or Mountains (*Berg/Gebirge*) or it could - unlikely - be the name of a river. But it can not be a region or province and definitely not an island, as these are all feminine. 

The text says "Hoch oben an den Hängen des Archolos" which translates to "High up at the slopes/hillsides of the Archolos", which makes it very clear that it is about a mountain.
