As far as transformation is concerned, that was always meant to be a water circle spell, the water is fluid, fits into every shape, so "shapeshift", as it was also called, is one of their skills. 

But earth, yes - the orcs and beliar stuff is very much related to this. In this context also do not forget the bloodearth clan (the orcs in the colony). 

For now concerning air, I was thinking into the direction of air and fire being very closely related and just some specialising into one or the other more. Like air is nourishing fire etc. And the combination of both leads to some interesting experiments and developments in Act II....^

(1) fire and air (always linked)
(2) air and water (no, rather seperated)
(3) earth and air (yes, they can coexist, the earth is breathing etc.)
(4) water and earth (yes, they can mix) 
(5) water and fire (yes, but only in isolation; they never fuse, but cooperate, cooking etc., all kinds of industrial processes too; also for the whole ore industry both are needed)
(6) earth and fire (well, that is like the deep, deep fire in the core of the earth, the stuff deep in the heart, a different form of dark fire not depending from the air but like nourished from within; or interpreted as: air/fire = fire from above, earth/fire = fire from below)

Just a very simplified scheme of course. But the idea is that this way basically four complexes remain.

fire/air,
earth/water,
air/earth
earth/fire

the kdf are rather specialised in the first, whereas these are two aspects of them.
the kdw are rather specialised in the second, earth, water, shapeshifting, being more close to nature/soil (less high in the air) etc. 
and the third would be like those deep in the ground. "breathing" earth. very connected to the earth, which are the more shamanistic orientated ones. 
and then there is earth/fire: that may be the beliar related stuff -> burning earth, burning bodies, working with earth through fire, re-kindling bodies. all that stuff. In this way the whole earth/fire complex, insofar as related to Beliar, could also be interpreted by some, in the mythology, in the way of Beliar having stolen some fire from the sun. Or something. This way, the other priests receive the "arcane gift", while the Beliaris take it.
In this context also blood - basically earth+fire, symbolically.

Delvin: Cannot air and water also be linked, like water can have two states frozen and liquid, depending on the temperature?

Mr Vincent: I was thinking of air being possibly related to Beliar because of my studies of greek mythology. In ancient greek, the ψυχή (Psychè) is the soul that leaves the body with the last breath and in the air the soul goes into realm of Hades, the underworld. In a more gothic way, Beliar acts like the breath that extinguishes the fire of a candle. The air is also the element of mobility so teleportation magic should have its origins in the circle of air.

I also have an idea for the earth being related to a fourth God, or more accurately, to a Goddess. In greek mythology the earth goddess is called Gea and it represents the primordial creation. The cult of the goddess could also be religion of amazons (since the sequel states that amazons exists in gothic world). 

So my take would be this: 
Innos-fire 
Adanos-Water
Beliar-Air
Female goddess-earth
/
Another possible idea could be indeed the idea of the three gods killing their father, like in greek mythology, so Innos, Adanos and Beliar had to govern respectively on sky, on water and on the underworld. Exactly as Zeus, Poseidon and Ades. The female goddess would be the mother of the gods, but her cult survives only in the amazons
The father in this case would be Ra

    -> Flosha:
    Actually, I have nothing against the idea of a female goddess at all and I agree that this may fit to the amazons.
    I just do not think that it should then be a part of the cult of the three gods.
    or an extension of it.
    But just a different cult.

        -> Mr. Vincent: And I totally agree with that. Since they are different cults, they have different opinions, the cult of the three gods denies the existence of this female goddess, while amazons claim she's the mother of the three gods. But your take also makes sense. I imagined them somehow related to also explain why the earth magic is mostly lost except for a very restricted number of people

Flosha: The gods do not have to be strongly related to these four elements. Yes, Innos is directly linked to fire and Adanos to water. But it is more like the complex mentioned above:
as innos fire/air
beliar: earth/fire (?)
adanos: water/earth 

Klaus: Although above I elaborated on the topic of connecting each element to a god myself, I think that it is absolutely ok to say that the elements are a part of the material world, of Morgrad and thus don't need to be fully aligned with the transcendent. /
I mean, in reality the teaching of the four elements is so old that it kept existing in many different kinds of religions and cultures, no matter how many gods people believed to exist. /
Well, the obvious weekness in my own argument is that the mages of Gothic name themselves after those elements but that still does not necessarily mean that everything has to be aligned around this idea.
