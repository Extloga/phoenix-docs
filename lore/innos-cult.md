## Father Metaphor

In Gothic, Innos is never described as a father or similar anthropocentric terms, but in a book in Gothic 1, the followers of Innos are described as the "Children of Fire".

In this way, the father metaphor does indeed make sense. While Beliar is associated with the moon, which is female in almost every language/culture. Innos is associated with creation/procreation, and so Beliar is associated with conception and the darkness of the womb into which the light is planted. So there may also be a mother association here, that may sometimes appear in the game - but it should not be prominent. Both associations should be used by the people of Myrtana in a consciously metaphorical way - they do not actually imagine them as such, as the gods in the universe are more transcendent in character.
