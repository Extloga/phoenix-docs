## To Innos Cult:

In Gothic, Innos is never described as a father or similar anthropocentric terms, but in a book in Gothic 1, the followers of Innos are described as the "children of fire".

In this way, the father metaphor does indeed make sense. While Beliar is associated with the moon, which is female in almost every language/culture. Innos is associated with creation/procreation, and so Beliar is associated with conception and the darkness of the womb into which the light is planted. So there may also be a mother association here, that may sometimes appear in the game - but it should not be prominent. Both associations should be used by the people of Myrtana in a consciously metaphorical way - they do not actually imagine them as such, as the gods in the universe are more transcendent in character.





## Burial Traditions

14.09.

Delvin: By the way, how do they handle the bodies of the dead, are they simply buried in the ground or cremated? And, returning to the previous discussion, who buries them, is there some profession?

Delvin: I guess, some would want the dead to be cremated, so there won't be undead.

Flosha: This is a good point. Innos followers may want to avoid that the most.
And the association with fire may suggest something like that.
While Adanos followers could prefer a burial at sea.
And Beliar in the earth.

Gothic does not tell us much in this regard. The only thing I remember now where something about ceremonies in this regard is told in the sources, is in the novel. Where they mention these copper (coins) that they place on the eyes.
From there we may be able to deduce something.

But I think this could be one aspect where people are rather free in the Cult. BUT it also is interesting because, by this decision at the end of life, they REALLY show which god they believe and feel connected to the most.
Which could lead to some denunciation.
Or to situations like this: A man wants to be buried in the beliar way or Adanos way or something. But the wife decides to do it otherwise because she doesn't want to confront the reactions.
Just a social thing. Nothing in the law.

Regarding this question. The more I think about it, the more I become convinced that it would be good to include Beliar priests in some form. The lore of the gods does not mention beliar priests, but also does not say that they do not exist. Only the manual said so (which has to be seen critical in several regards; we also deviate from it in some other regards because it is in conflict with some essential ideas by Mike regarding succession to the throne and everything). So when going with what just the other sources tell us, like the lore of the gods, we could just say that it simply keeps quiet about the beliar priests.

The arcane gift, the access to magic, which is associated with being "elected", receiving this gift, this has to be the primary distinction.
Not this "priest" term.
So there can be beliar priests in the universe, in the sense we discussed it before, just excluded from or very restricted in magic, which ofc some are practicing nonetheless underhand.
And so either them would be responsible for the burial, or perhaps a different priest depending on which kind of burial someone wanted.

Delvin: On the other hand it makes the god of dead a bit less "present/involved", but sounds nice.
