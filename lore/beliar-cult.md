## Burial Traditions

14.09.

Delvin: I guess, some would want the dead to be cremated, so there won't be undead.

Flosha: This is a good point. Innos followers may want to avoid that the most.
And the association with fire may suggest something like that.
While Adanos followers could prefer a burial at sea.
And Beliar in the earth.

Gothic does not tell us much in this regard. The only thing I remember now where something about ceremonies in this regard is told in the sources, is in the novel. Where they mention these copper (coins) that they place on the eyes.
From there we may be able to deduce something.

But I think this could be one aspect where people are rather free in the Cult. BUT it also is interesting because, by this decision at the end of life, they REALLY show which god they believe and feel connected to the most.
Which could lead to some denunciation.
Or to situations like this: A man wants to be buried in the beliar way or Adanos way or something. But the wife decides to do it otherwise because she doesn't want to confront the reactions.
Just a social thing. Nothing in the law.
