## Burial Traditions

14.09.

Delvin: By the way, how do they handle the bodies of the dead, are they simply buried in the ground or cremated? And, returning to the previous discussion, who buries them, is there some profession?

Delvin: I guess, some would want the dead to be cremated, so there won't be undead.

Flosha: This is a good point. Innos followers may want to avoid that the most.
And the association with fire may suggest something like that.
While Adanos followers could prefer a burial at sea.
And Beliar in the earth.

Gothic does not tell us much in this regard. The only thing I remember now where something about ceremonies in this regard is told in the sources, is in the novel. Where they mention these copper (coins) that they place on the eyes.
From there we may be able to deduce something.

But I think this could be one aspect where people are rather free in the Cult. BUT it also is interesting because, by this decision at the end of life, they REALLY show which god they believe and feel connected to the most.
Which could lead to some denunciation.
Or to situations like this: A man wants to be buried in the beliar way or Adanos way or something. But the wife decides to do it otherwise because she doesn't want to confront the reactions.
Just a social thing. Nothing in the law.

Regarding this question. The more I think about it, the more I become convinced that it would be good to include Beliar priests in some form. The lore of the gods does not mention Beliar Priests, but also does not say that they do not exist. Only the manual said so (which has to be seen critical in several regards; we also deviate from it in some other regards because it is in conflict with some essential ideas by Mike regarding succession to the throne and everything). So when going with what just the other sources tell us, like the lore of the gods, we could just say that it simply keeps quiet about the beliar priests.

The Arcane Gift, the access to magic, which is associated with being "elected", receiving this gift, this has to be the primary distinction.
Not this "Priest" term.
So there can be Beliar Priests in the universe, in the sense we discussed it before, just excluded from or very restricted in magic, which ofc some are practicing nonetheless underhand.
And so either them would be responsible for the burial, or perhaps a different priest depending on which kind of burial someone wanted.

Delvin: On the other hand it makes the god of dead a bit less "present/involved", but sounds nice.

Hagen: I will have to think and sleep about it. My first reaction is that both ideas (beliar-only burials or different burials for different cults) are interesting but that I would rather like Beliar (and Beliar priests) generally being responsible for death, burial and rememberance of the dead including liturgical services regarding that. It has a major advantage, because it would make the world more 'gothic':

Afterall, one of the most interesting aspects of Beliar in the perspective we are building through discussions and documents is that he is dark but he is also just and necessary (contrary to the twisted narrative of G2 and onwards). The necessity of death plays a huge part in gothic and darkwave subcultures, because it is vastly underrepresented in our (post-)modern times, our everyday life, our experience and popular culture. This under-representation is countered with over-representation in those subcultures. And while being afraid of death and not wanting to think too much about it is natural for men, it is also natural and necessary to place it into a context and build a perspective towards it.
In the imperial cult of three complementary gods in a truely gothic universe, Beliar could play this role of the unwanted but necessary representative of both death and the way to deal with death. I also like our thoughts from last week, in which we imagined Beliar (or rather his followers) to be distrusted, while his cult itself cannot be destroyed because although it is unwanted, it is still needed for everyone. Even for the followers of Innos and Adanos.
We can also imagine that those followers (of Innos and Adanos) are much more prone to accept and adapt the imperial religious narrative (three god cult), while Beliar probably has the most followers who feel supressed by it. At the same time, the cult of three gods, as far as we know, explicitly tells believers that Beliar is responsible for the dead, doesn't it?

So the Beliar cult being the only cult responsible for burial and rememberance would embrace the very gothic idea that no matter how people live, think, believe and pray, nobody of them can escape or negate death. It is necessary. And this manifests itself in the cult of Beliar. It makes death, darkness, loss and rememberance touchable. It embodies all of that.

So I tend to say that beliar-only burials are more interesting and more "gothic" than a potpourri of death and burial cults.

Maybe we could bring in diversity regarding cult practice through rather small adjustment. Brainwave: Maybe everyone would go to a Beliar priest to bury his loved ones. But maybe the follower of one god would want to put coins on the corpse's eyes, the other one would put a candle, blessed by a priest of Innos, in the grave (so Innos' light may guide the dead through Beliar's darkness) etc.
