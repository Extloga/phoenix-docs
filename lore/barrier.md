## Quotes

> The bright winter sky grew gray and dark as thick black clouds obscured the
sun. Lightning flashed across the sky darting through a whirlwind of energy as the Mages cast the spell using the Foci. A blue-hazed sheet drove across the mine, passing the boundaries of will (...) / And so it came to pass that fleeing from greed itself brought greed and thus
tribulations upon King Rhobar. [M]


WHY:
> In order to save his most precious mine in Khorinis. [M]
