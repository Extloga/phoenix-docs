## Monster Names

*flosha, 18.04.2023*

Just as the names of characters we also have to translate the names of monsters. The release version presents a strange and inconsistent mixture of english and german names. In some cases we even *know* some original german names of monsters that just were not used in the end. 

The "Shadowbeast" is a "Schattenläufer", which would be translated more literally as "Shadowstrider". But for something like the "Scavenger" they just kept the english term. A bloodfly was translated into a "Blutfliege"; while an original term like "Felsfresser", as which it was even called in dialogues of design documents, in the end did only appear under the english term "Minecrawler". Just as with the names of NPCs we can only assume that it was done since they thought that the english terms sounded cooler. But it is inconsistent and has to be changed.
