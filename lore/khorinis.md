## Etymology

We can either assume that the word is comprised of two words such as "Khor+Inis", as suggested by Avallach, or we can assume it to be "Khorin" with a suffix "-is" as it appears in words such as basis or polaris, which I suggested.  

* **Korin** is a name and an alternate form of *Corin*, which, as the contributor Ben found, may come from *Quirinus*, an epithet of Mars, the god of war, which according to Ovid could originate from a language related to latin with a potential meaning of the *"lance (bearer)"*. (Interestingly we became aware of this just *after* I had the idea that Khorin once brought the sceptre of Varant to Khorinis.) Additionally, when *Quirinus* is pronounced in a latin manner, it sounds almost like "Khorinis" already. 

* ***-aris*** is used to form an adjective in latin, usually from a noun, indicating a relationship or a pertaining to. Example: Sol (sun) → solaris (of the sun). In this sense, Khorinis could mean as much as "of Khorin" or "belonging to Khorin".

* ***Khor*** is a middle egyptian reference to Canaan in the ancient near east and a later name of the syrian region which before was called "Retjenu". In ossetian, *xor* stands for "sun", also see *xorsu* for "good", from which the russian хороший (good) was speculated to come from, which would then mean as much as "of Khors, belonging to Khors". Also see *Khors*, a slavic god mentioned since the 12h century, usually interpreted as a sun good, sometimes as a moon god too. Also see *Khorasan* from middle persian Xwarasan, which means as much as "where the sun arrives from" or "the Eastern Province", as it was the name given to the eastern province of Persia during the Sasanian Empire, covering the lands from the Levant to India, from South Arabia to the Caucasus at the black sea. In Arabic, *Khor* or *Khawr* is an inlet ("a narrow strip of water which goes from a sea or lake into the land", e.g. *Khor al Adaid*, both a settlement and an inlet of the Persian Gulf). Synonyms: bay, creek, cove (which fits insofar as that the water in the colony belongs in fact to the sea and especially on older maps of the game world it is very much a creek in the land).

* ***inis*** old irish/welsh for "island" but *ynys* in welsh also more general as *piece of land*, *realm*, *territory*. E.g. Ynis Afallon - the famous "Avalon" from the legends.

Based on this research and the idea of Khorin-is, it is an obvious and easy explanation for Khorinis to mean as much as the territory/valley and city "of Khorin", a saint from past days, as I originally suggested. 

Based on the idea of Khor-Inis it could mean as much as the "island of the sun", "the island in the east", "the territory in the east", or the "eastern creek". It is noteworthy that Avalon (Ynis Affalon) was sometimes also described as a valley instead of an island in medieval sources and so Khorinis could as well mean as much as "the valley of the east". 

Both explanations are valid, they aren't necessarily causing any conflict and can be combined. 

Khorinis as "of Khorin" has two meanings depending on what people refer to. They may refer to it as the city (Khorinis then: city of Khorin), sometimes to the territory such as the valley surrounding the city and the colony beneath (Khorinis then = valley/region of Khorin).

magical Ore and forged them into the strongest weapons in the land (...) [M]


## Strategic importance

The manual makes it very clear, that magical ore is *only* to be found in Khorinis. The king would not erect a magical barrier around the colony, if the colony wouldn't be of the utmost strategic importance for the war. The small size of the colony and the relatively little amounts of magical ore that the prisoners deliver, does not make this any less plausible or less realistic, since we do not know how many of these "strongest weapons in the land" can be produced by even little amounts of this specific ore, as it may not itself be used to forge weapons that consist entirely of magical ore, but rather be melted to be used as a coating for these royal blades. One big sack of ore can potentially yield a plethora of swords. 


## Position of Khorinis

* There is a "labour camp", a "penal colony" at the "royal mines" of Khorinis. The penal colony belongs to the city Khorinis, which is "far away from the big royal cities in the centre of the realm" and described as being "at the outmost corner of the world".
* This place can not be at the "western provinces" of the realm, as a character in the novel describes himself as coming from there. Thus it has to be at the eastern part of Myrtana, which fits to the etymology of "Khor" as refering to the sun and the east, such as *Khorasan* as the "eastern province"; at the same time it is far away from the center of the realm, so it has to be either in the far south or in the north.
* In the south lies Varant and what is described in the novel as the "southern provinces", from which another character comes from, so Khorinis can neither be there (nor in Varant). It could at most be at the southern border of the eastern provinces to the southern provinces above Varant (the location where the battles took place when Varant invaded Myrtana through their borders ashore); but this seems unlikely too as this place between the realms would be at an important trade route, very much opposed to a city "at the outmost corner of the world". 
* Thus, the most likely explanation is for Khorinis to be at the northeastern corner of the realm, an explanation which is additionally supported by another source (official website) that says, that Milten fled from his outpost to the *"next city"*. And since the outpost is at the northern plains, Khorinis cannot be in the south. Khorinis has both to be close to the northern plains as well as far enough away from the battles; displayed in the Comic accordingly, where the City is located in a valley surrounded by mountains at which Milten arrived after travelling through the mountain ranges (which, further east, are even covered by snow). 
* The City is *very* close to the colony, as according to [the Pass Concept Art](https://media.gothicarchive.org/conceptart/ralfmarczinczik/surface/Abschnitt_A1_AlterPass.jpg) by Ralf Marczinczik, it can be *seen*, even if in quite some distance, from *within* the barrier. 


### Climate

The rather mediterranean climate of the colony with burned grass and people being able to run around without much or any kind of cover, which would otherwise serve as a reasoning for a position further south, is explained in the novel by the barrier and is thereby not a sufficient reasoning against a position in the north of Myrtana:

The barrier is both blocking light to some degree (leading to that desired depressive gothic atmosphere within the colony that was initially aimed for) and still makes it much warmer inside, almost like a conservatory. At the same time not much (if any) rain can pass, resulting in the dryness of most of the soil, except for the areas around the rivers.

Outside of the barrier, on the other hand, we can see conifer trees on the hills surrounding the colony, as displayed both in the Comic and on all of the concept arts by Ralf Marczinczik; which can be seen as an additional confirmation of the ideas above, that it is quite a bit colder outside of the barrier.  


## Khorinis as an Island

[In 1998](https://gothicarchive.org/interviews/1998/14.11.1998_voodooextreme.com.txt), Mike said the following:
> […] We needed to limit the size of the world, therefore we planned to place the prison on an island, but then we decided in favor of the magic barrier, because it emphasizes the feeling of being imprisoned. 

At the same time, he clarified to us [in 2020](https://gothicarchive.org/postrelease/interviews/MikeHoge_30_12_2020.html), that...
> There was no worldmap when we did Gothic 1, so it was neither on the mainland, nor on an island at that point.

They *had* the *idea* of an island at first, because of *Escape from New York*, *the* essential inspiration to Gothic, which is taking place in Manhatten, but the idea was discarded in favour of the magical barrier (which was an idea by Stefan Nyul) and at that point there was no concept of the world around it, only fragments. When the Sequel was being developed by Nyul and Brüggemann (the other two of the four founders of the team apart from Mike Hoge and Tom Putzki) and when they decided to let their project take place in the colony only, - which they were forced to do since they didn't have enough level designers to do more than an overhaul of the colony, as all the former level designers decided to help Mike with his shooter project *Unplugged* instead, that sadly never came to fruition - there was still no reason to clarify the position of the colony within the world of Gothic. But as the idea had been discarded during the conception phase of Gothic, they did not imagine it being situated on an island.  
And the Comic, that was considered canonical and showed the city of Khorinis (that Milten travelled to *by foot* from the northern plains (in the north of Myrtana), with Khorinis being the "*next* city" from there, as the official website informed us) - and thus showing us a part of the outside world - surrounded by huge mountain massives, has thus obviously given no reason to imagine an island either. While the barrier was gone, the game world of the Sequel was meant to be limited by the inability to swim out of the world (due to monsters in the sea) and orcs (for reasons related to the story) being placed around all the exits of the valley. 

There is *one* mentioning of an island though, as quoted above. In the design documentation of story version 3, there is written a dialogue of Ka-Garon, one of the "higher" novices: 
> Be welcome, brother in spirit. You have found, what you searched for. The only place of freedom and happiness that exists *on this dreary island*. [D]

Independent of the question if Khorinis and the colony are situated on an actual island, we can definitely think of it as an island in a metaphorical meaning, due to its secluded position ("ore island" may be a common term). Just as the Orgas as "ore pirates" are pirates in a metaphorical sense, the colony as this valley surrounded by the barrier is like a metaphorical island - far more secluded than any island, as it is not surrounded by water, which men could at least overcome by ships, but by unbreachable and insurmountable magic.

But *if* Khorinis is an *actual* island, based on all the findings before and the inspiration from *Escape from New York*, it is most reasonable to assume it to be either an island like Manhatten - which means being extremely close to the mainland, almost connected with it - or perhaps to be *indeed* connected with it partially, as a peninsula (german "Halbinsel", meaning "half-island"); a solution by which we can merge the idea of an island inspired by the dark anarchist Manhatten in *Escape from New York* (at first imagined as a level limitation, then discarded when Nyul had the idea of the magical barrier, but still kept in the back of their mind as a potential geographic solution for later), with the idea of it being located on the mainland, as the Sequel and Comic seemed to assume - in that it is directly connected to the Northeast of Myrtana through a mountain pass and also lies to some degree within the Myrtanian Sea as seen in the creek of the colony (and potentially within a myrtanian gulf (see Myrtana)). It is thus far away from the center of the realm due to its secluded position in the northeast, *not* due to it being far away on the sea. This is what we end up with when following all the early sources and ideas consequently.



## Phoenix Solutions

Please note that here we are primarily focusing on the definition and role of Khorinis as a location in the grand scheme of the history of Myrtana, while the more elaborated history of the City in particular will be dealt with in the city design documentation.

* A long time ago a fire alchemist brought the "lance of the sun" (khor = sun, korin = lance - the Sceptre of Varant) to the city, wherefore he would later be known as "Khorin". He came to be considered a saint and buried at the old temple of fire (which may have been founded by or in the name of him - which is why the local Order of Fire in Khorinis is known as "the Order of Khorin") and the city named after him. This does *not* mean that the city itself has been *founded* by him; a city has been here long before and there may already have been a holy place here, which is why he brought the sceptre here, from where it would later find its way into the hands of the myrtanian kings (see lore/history).

* Khorinis is located in the northeast of the eastern side of Myrtana, not too far away from the Northern Plains, but far enough to be imagined by Milten - at the time of his desertion - to be unlikely affected by the war anytime soon, as it is focused on or expected to be pushed towards mostly the central, royal cities, which Khorinis is far away from. (It is thus obviously not the ore that the orcs are after.) Geographically the colony and the city are on a mountainous peninsula with direct access to the Myrtanian Sea. 

* The colony of Khorinis is the only (known or accessible) place in the kingdom where magical ore occurs (for reasons explained in our /lore) and is thus of the highest strategical importance in the current war of Myrtana. *After* the revolt of the prisoners (see [The Revolt]) the king therefore decided to send the most powerful mages of the realm to erect a magical barrier around the colony. 

* Khorinis is also the only place in the kingdom where all these strange creatures and mutations occur or are initially coming from - they are in many cases not *known* or very rarely seen in other areas of the realm (due to reasons also explained in our /lore; you may also read [Gothic defined](/vision/gothic-defined)). 

* Additionally, the erection of the barrier led to the first disturbance of the sleeper in his sleep, causing the ritual to go wrong, the barrier to increase in size and the mages to become prisoners of the prison they created. 

* Since its erection the barrier is heavily influencing the climate within the colony and affects the atmosphere and the depressive, gloomy mood of the game world.
