# Cultic Scriptures


## Lore of the Gods

An ingame book in Gothic consisting of three volumes.
Below we will quote the entire book with a very short analysis of what it implies.  

A more elaborated commentary with an interpretation of the texts is given in the Phoenix Section.

> Höre die Worte der Götter, denn es ist ihr Wille, dass sie gehört werden. Befolge die Lehren der Götter, denn es ist ihr Wille, dass sie befolgt werden. Achte die Priester der Götter, denn sie sind erwählt.

The first volume is more moral in character, the second volume deals with the creation of the world and life and the third volume establishes the superiority of priesthood and talks of the "fall of magic". From this general layout we can deduce a primarily moral intention and focus of the scripture.  

It seems that mythological and historical records are melting together in the books, alongside a ideological colouration of the author, which can be speculated to be a Priest of Fire based on his negative description of the Circle of Water, of which he writes that they *"... directed their prayers to Adanos and forgot their origin"*.

It is also important to notice, that inspite of the authors ideological bias against the Adanos cult, he clearly demands in Volume I to "follow the will of the gods" in plural and to respect the Priests in general, which includes the priests of Adanos.

Due to these characteristics we can deduce that the book was written during the time of Rhobar I. or II. (which we summarise as the "New Empire"), after the reconciliation of the House of Innos and the House of Adanos under Rhobar.
