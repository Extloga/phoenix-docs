Delvin: Can you elaborate a bit more on how people perceive Beliar as part of the Cult of the Three Gods, considering that Beliar does not have "legal/official" followers, because as it is said, "the cultic practice of the followers of Beliar is done in secrecy, since the worship of Beliar is condemned by the priests"  and "the magic assigned to Beliar, such as the summoning of demons, is banned and considered as heresy",

so how people perceive the god, whose followers are associated with heretics and his magic as heresy? And what about a rite for the departed, some sort of burying the dead; this would for sure fall under Beliar in this proposition, or rather under his followers, who would organise and perform such a rite,

11.09.2024
Flosha: While the god keeps playing an important role in everyday life, the actual "cult" of Beliar is not practiced openly (anymore!), that he is on one hand surrounded both by an aura of great awe and you cannot deny his ultimate grip on your life and the end in his realm, where everyone goes to, but at the same time also a general feeling of "do not get in touch with him too closely, as it is dangerous!" In the sense of: "See what he did to the orcs! See what he did to the first empire!"
In our lore, during the first empire or perhaps the fallen civilization before, there were indeed priests of Beliar and they developed out of the archaic castes, but they vanished and were started to be pushed out of the public sphere after the collapse of the civilisation due to the demonic cataclysm. Therefore it is now forbidden to practice the dark magic, including both all interference with demons as well as necromancy and so on. 

Which, at least partially, is also affecting the mages of the other circles, because the most powerful magic in e.g. the water circle, is the resurrection. And the resurrection of the dead, according to the sources, only the leader of the KdW (Saturas) was capable of. And since it is interfering with the dead, you can very much say that it is edging towards necromancy and it includes the danger of creating a Zombie instead etc. Which is also in accordance with Story 3.3 where one of the KdW very much experiences into this direction. And this again makes it very reasonable that the KdW leader is a secret disciple of the Demon Summoner too, as is the alpha lore, since in order to achieve the highest magic of his circle, he is basically forced to deal with dark magic to some degree. So its never done publicly.

---

But as you say, rites like the burying of the dead, still have to be performed. Who should do that? I have no final answer about that yet. On one hand we could explain that this is just done by the people themselves, laymen are doing it. 

---

On the other hand - and I may say that I kind of like this idea - we could of course decide to divert from the sources regarding the existence of priests of Beliar, so that we can have regular Beliar temples and shrines in Khorinis - although it still should be rare, simply due to the people not preferring him, as written in the scripts, the night, Beliar and all he stands for, was always rejected and always oppressed. Hades in Greece too had not that much of a cult compared to the others. But still a temple of Beliar would then be seen as totally normal, as in Egypt with Osiris. There would then indeed be kind of priests too, just that in opposition to the priests of Innos and Adanos, they would not be allowed to study or practice magic. Their job would be limited to care for the temples, to care for the dead and to perform specific rites that do not interfer with Beliar, in the sense of: What Beliar has taken, should with Beliar remain. What is dead should be dead. And the demons should stay in the shadows where they belong while trying to shed the light of Innos on the world everywhere in order to reduce these shadows, metaphorically speaking. 

But a scripture like the lore of the gods would then in need to be changed into a differentiation between priests with and priests without the "arcane gift" = initiation into magic.  These ideas are open to debate. We try to stick to the sources as best as possible, but we may also divert from one if it helps to improve upon another aspect of the sources, that seems more important to us, such as a proper establishment of Beliar in the world as a god of the dead. 

And maybe there are other, more subtle means and ideas inbetween the solutions I suggested here.

Klaus:
Ra being the real creator-god and the others being divine creatures(?) or spiritual personifications of his diverse essence is much more believable.
[...]
It is absolutely possible that divine reality translates into a twisted form of itself – thus creating the discrepancy regarding Myrtana's gods.
[...]
I would agree, @flosha, that there is definitely a need to distance oneself from a thing here and there of the lore, especially regarding Beliar. The problem with Beliar is, that the lore makes him a necessary part of divine reality and thus worship/veneration, while it gives him exceptionally evil properties/attributes/decisions. For example: It makes sense that Ra wants worship or at least veneration of the lesser gods as they express different parts of his divine essence. So it makes sense that also every god also wants to see the other ones being worshipped/venerated. But Beliar, out of vanity and pride, practically commited a Satanic act by reacting to a lack of his veneration (or worship, I will stop writing that out) by creating something which only venerates him.

So the question is: Did Beliar really do this? Is this part of the lore's divine reality? Or is it a false narrative, people in Myrtana made up or misunderstood?

In the first case he would not just bepart of the necessary but went rogue indeed. And then it would be weird to not call him evil and see him as an antagonist.
But if he really did not do this but people just claim that he did that and in reality he, just as the other gods, wants equal veneration for all, we have an interesting twist which could fertilize both main and side plots. This could be a way out of this uncanny valley of evil Beliar.

And another important thing would be to reinvestigate Beliar's relationship with demons then. Maybe as a dark god of the netherworld, he is not sending demons but rather containing them? Holding them back in their place? What would be the implications for most people (if we assume that of course) not venerating Beliar? What would be the implications for the few people who are only venerating Beliar, doing that in a wrong way of course and to gain power over death and demons?

Summary, Flosha: 


* We need to clarify how we want the gods to be perceived in Phoenix: 
    * the gods were not really established as a fact, like: It is absolutely clear that they exist in Gothic. This also was something that only came with the successors. There it is no question of belief anymore and this is something we really try to avoid.
    * There should not be an "actual", "factual" divine reality that we establish as the truth of the lore, but different interpretations that can stand beside each other and keep room for interpretation of the player. But still we should ofc have coherent possible, potential explanations and an idea of how specfic changes in belief and the religious history of Myrtana came about. 
    * Klaus: "If you form a believable world, it offers as many interpretations as our world does. [...] (Enderal) It is not just dark (which I like), but it is nihilistic, desperate and Freudian. It does not leave open the possibility of a higher cause, of a hero's journey etc.. Just the abyss. (...) Leaving it open also strengthens the opportunities to roleplay and to choose different paths. There is no forced discrepancy between my character and myself then."
    * Flosha: If the texts would be 100% factual, that would also automatically make the gods 100% factual, while in Phoenix it is not even supposed to be clear if they exist or not. Many believe so, but we do not want to establish this as a fact, as was done in the successors
    * Klaus: Leaving it open also strengthens the opportunities to roleplay and to choose different paths. There is no forced discrepancy between my character and myself then. So I am absolutely in favour of this.



* Klaus: 11.09.2024: Beliar is not "sending" demons, he is "containing" them. He is holding them back where the people push them to (by oppression) and so on; people themselves evoke them consciously or unconsciously.
    * Delvin 11.09.2024: KryptoKlaus expressed quite an interesting idea of Beliar's and demons association, that Beliar is rather containing the demons and your thoughts that what is dead should stay dead. I think that this could be part of the propaganda of the new "forced" religion. But I don't know your exact plans on the demons though.


* Add to the Tutelaries part (all 11.09.2024):
    * Klaus: For what purposes and in which situations will people pray to/worship/venerate the gods, including Beliar? 
    * Klaus: From a practical point of view, it would be very interesting to make a list of dozens of both mundane and special actions and situations people are in and allocate to each action/situation one or more gods. Meaning to which god someone would pray.
    * Klaus: If we have an understanding of what people could want from Beliar, we could then think about what a (non-wicked) Beliar cult could look like and what a Beliar priest would do. Because a priest is a mediator between the divine and the people. So the wishes and hopes of the people are almost as elementary regarding the work and cult of a priest as the god itself is.
    * Klaus: with such a list, we will get a good feeling of what Beliar means to the people of Myrtana. And I have the feeling that more and more we will come to the conclusion that among criminals there will be exceptionally many people praying to Beliar. -> Flosha: Good transition into the Beliar Cult part! 

    
* Klaus: My suggestion would be twofold:
    1) Attributes and characteristics of all Gods should be written out more deeply and distinguished from another. 
        * Klaus: If Beliar is repsonsible for the dead, he is also responsible for remembering them. What if he is responsible for rememberance and all of what happens in the mind generally speaking? 
        * Klaus: @Delvin already pointed towards the shadows and darkness being a symbol of dreams, linking the topic to the spheres document. If we connect Beliar mainly with Shagrad, then all of this really makes sense.
        * Klaus: People also turn towards Beliar for the far-fetched things they dream of. Also something which is not evil in itself, but always bears the potential of leading into evil or at least strengthening vices. Because people have dreams (not literally) of being rich, powerful etc. And we know where this leads to. / So our grasp of a Beliar not being evil in itself but because of his nature always having the potential of driving people into evil, is getting stronger and stronger. 
        * the little Sequel text speaks of "Dreifaltigkeit" in this context. Imo the text is quite good and didn't add any negative aspects to their lore, and through the wording can be easily seen in the context of them being aspects of Ra etc.
        * Delvin: so some people would lean towards the idea to "realise" desires in their lives, ether good or bad, through Beliar or Shagrad.
        * Innos/Flosha: In general we may say that the "senses", the consciousness, this was given by Innos, according to the books. 



* Add to Divine Law / Justice:
    * Klaus 11.09.2024:
    Innos' justice is vertical. It is about Hierarchy (which is Greek and literally means holy rule). It's about leading and serving. It's about what we Germans call(ed) „Stand“ and for which I can't find a proper English word. 
    In traditional Europe it meant everything in which God put people. Personal profession, marital status, being commoner, nobleman or cleric, being an apprentice, assistant or master, being rich or poor etc.. Doing what your Stand demands and getting what it demands. Having both rights and proportional duties according to your Stand. Very important in Medieval times. Innos' justice is bound to that. It's destiny and following that with dignity. This hierarchy does not necessarily mean that it's always top-down regarding leading and serving. It can be serving out of a position of power, but still in a vertical/unequal way. For example: Chivalry which demands that the strong defend the weak. Defend the righteous from the wicked. Punishing the unrighteous for the sake of order and stability. Everyone comes to his right and his duties. So it contains charity, but rather in a soldierly way of being courageous, active, diligent.
    Adanos' justice is rather horizontal: It also contains charity, but rather a fraternal one. Or in case of a defacto hierarchy (strong and weak) it is a more dignifying charity. Examples: Justice towards Friends and neighbours, giving food to the starving, eating with them without looking at differences, healing the sick etc. Putting emphasis on the individual's dignity and right to justice, but not in an uprising/rebelling manner.
    Now Beliar's justice is difficult. The only residual kind of justice I can think of is a much more subjective and personal justice. That makes sense, because given the above, Innos' justice is the most objective one and Adanos seems to be in the middle. It also fits because subjective, personal justice is essentially: vengeance or revenge. And I think this we can intuitively associate with Beliar.
    people will [...] turn towards a diety because the have a will, they have emotions, they are in need of something. They don't just want abstract justice, like I described above, so we have to think what emotions and desires are linked to the God's attribute on the human side.
    This would be the above mentioned vengeance for example, for which people go to Beliar. Someone steals from them, so they turn to Beliar to curse him. Someone kills their loved one so they swear to Beliar to take revenge.
    If people feel treaten like they are not human beings and want more equality (not in the modern meaning), they turn towards Adanos. They pray to Adanos so he may repay someone good deeds. That is also justice afterall.
    * Delvin, 11.09.2024: [...] Beliar's vengeance is the opposition to Innos's justice. And Innos's justice is more like on the higher level, like law/order.
    * Klaus: I could also imagine people would use Beliar as an excuse to justify doing a "lesser evil". „The end justify the means“. What we do may be dark and ugly, but it is necessary. Such as death and darkness. / Thieves and assassins would turn to Beliar so he hides them in the darkness. But also a hunted, righteous person could do this.
        * Flosha: "the end justifies the means" maxime is something that is pretty much related to Xardas in our understanding."
    * Klaus: Especially from the low fantasy approach it is important that people are just people. That isn't just grim and shows us their worst psychological problems (the Enderal approach), but it is also true in a positive way. Most people don't turn to Beliar for something evil. They don't want demons or occultism. They are looking at him for his positive traits. Even the criminals. But they, as people living in the dark and less respected, may have a better understanding of what makes Beliar so positive at all. 
    * Flosha: Apart from what e.g. justice means to the people in regard to these gods, we should also look at in which way the gods relate to each other and how e.g. beliar helps innos law in his role of the punisher of those who act against it - or may sometimes not act accordingly but in a different way and how adanos somehow keeps the balance inbetween. That is also an aspect that I still find a bit confusing.
    --> So on one hand, distinguish: Justice in relation between Gods to Men. Justice in relation between the Gods. -> relation system.
        * Justice between the gods, Klaus, 11.09.2024: the balance is the biggest problem, as long as there is a hierarchy. It makes sense if Innos is not Ra. But if it is merged into the same, then balance between a higher and a lesser god is a logical problem hard to solve.
            * Flosha: But it fits into the scheme. We should first develop this balance as imagined between the three gods if Ra is thought to stand above/beyond them as the divine Absolute and the source of it all. With the identification of Ra with Innos, the problems arise. But I don't mean the problems for us in clarifying the lore, but a - at least in the eyes of some people - problematic development of the religion in Myrtana, as Innos is kind of getting out of hand/taking over more and more.
            * Klaus: Having one plausible picture in the back of the mind but the other one, even if not fully logic, can be the reality of the divine cult.
    * Delvin: 11.09.2024: Since water mages (at least from the colony) oppose what the king does, especially oppressive laws and other things he imposes on the citizens. Perhaps instead of focusing on what is just, they are rather focusing on what is unjust? I don't know how to incorporate this into the lore though, and whether it makes sense at all  





* TO BELIAR CULT: We need to include beliar priests:
    * but in a way to clearly differentiate their role from the role of the Innos and Adanos priests. Priests of Innos and Adanos are described as "Erwählte", the "Elected" ones. Those who received the "divine gift", the arcane gift. 
         they have the "arcane" gift. The one that the beliar priests, if we introduce them, would not be allowed to receive.
    * The priests of Beliar are not allowed to practice magic, they are not seen as "elected" ones, they are not considered safe to bestow them of the arcane gift. Therefore: When a beliar priest is somehow caught brewing mana potions, it is immediately clear that he is somehow practicing magic or trying to - and this is forbidden. Ofc there are hidden beliar circles where dark magic is practiced nonetheless, but they are operating very secretly. 
    * Delvin, 11.09.2024: As I understand it, because of the demonic cataclysm, Beliar's priests/followers or rather their practices with the dark magic are considered quite dangerous and harmful overall, and because of this, despite their god being part of the cult, they haven't gotten the same "power" as other older cults got.
    * Delvin: 11.09.2024: [beliar magic being forbidden] would only create some secret inner sects among the priests, which would feel oppressed by the empire for "castrating" them so to speak, additionally to the secretive priests that you described in the document, which are not affiliated with the empire by any means. The count of those official representatives, would be relatively small, because their role in the cult would be quite reduced to burying the dead and rites associated with this, and some teachings about the importance of the night/darkness, etc., which is now part of the teachings of the cult of the three gods.
    * Delvin: Found a cool picture, which can be the inspiration (in some way) for the empire's "humiliated/oppressed/subdued" priests of the dead, night and moon. (Hermes (Ερμής) guiding Souls in the Underworld (1898) - Adolf Hirémy-Hirschl) - https://64.media.tumblr.com/0b6af6fe36eb5d13c30d91deaaba6c57/tumblr_pllf9nq5a41y487zeo1_1280.jpg 
    * Klaus, 11.09.2024: Innos and Adanos have very exoteric cults, while the cult of Beliar naturally tends to turn esoteric, even if not intended from the beginning. You implied something similar.
    * Klaus: This could be an interesting approach to the topic. A cult of Beliar is accepted and even demanded, but it is never trusted. Not because it would be wrong to worship Beliar, but because his followers tend to do more than what is allowed and watchable. That opens up many opportunities. A priest of Beliar could be responsible for the dead, burying liturgies, remembering*** the dead etc.. Now imagine the typical priest is just doing that but there is also a significant amount of Beliar priests being available for a bit dirty work. For example the above mentioned cursing of a thief or knowingly taking donations from criminals. There could be a wide range of things which are not so clean, but also not pure evil and demonic. And this could be designed fluently, maybe with each and individual priest drawing their own red lines. This would also open up opportunities for insights in inner debates and fights, you can imagine: "We are not allowed to do that!", "This is not Beliar!", "You are responsible for our bad reputation!" etc.
    * Klaus: Only the smallest minority would turn absolutely dangerous, summon demons etc.. The question then is: How much of shadows and darkness is acceptible and needed in the reality of men 




* We need to add a section interpreting the section in the lore about beliar and his men that only venerates him etc. See Klaus above + Flosha (11.09.2024):
    * Regarding the myth of beliar creating a man only to venerate him etc., this at least I think the article hints at as a potential interpretation of the fire priest writing it and an explanation for the existence of the orcs and the racism against them. 
    * Flosha: That this man is the species of the Orcs is only *one* interpretation of the holy texts that the Inquisition likes to use.



* We need to point out and explain that right now in the new Empire there is "a dominion of the house of fire in the empire that this aspect is now, currently in high focus in the myrtanian regime, with all its constant wars and its inquisition and oppression" (flosha: 11.09.2024)

* We need to add a section in the document about faith in the colony and the primary role of Beliar in that context, referring to Kasakk in the story + adding here Klaus' notes regarding religion among criminals:
    11.09.2024
    * "The Sicilian Mafia is highly religious or at least was in it's beginning. They even have religious initiation rites (I remember something about holding a burning icon in the hands without dropping it while swearing loyalty)."
    * "Medieval criminals venerated certain saints as patrons for criminals. For example St. Nicholas as patron saint for thieves. Or they venerated saints which they just associated with the poor, weak, despised people. The first being a rogue form of the official religion, the latter being in accordance with it."
    * "In Catholic countries many criminals donate to the Church and/or prohobit stealing from it. I remember a case from the German Rhineland in which something was stolen from a Church and later was found in an empty car in front of a monastery. -> Obviously a thief with bad conscience or his boss told him to give that back."
    * "A very dark (and evil) thing are the criminal cults which exist in South America like Santa Muerte (link below). Just read about it a bit. It is extremely important to many criminals. Thinking about this, it would be plausible if there would be a higher (rogue) veneration of Beliar in the colony, similar to this."
    * Delving: 11.09.2024: Yes, especially if considering that the cult of the three gods was established by force by the kingdom/empire they despise.


* We need to add some kind of a rudimentary eschatology:
    * Klaus, 11.09.2024: one thing which (as far as I know) is not mentioned in your quotes from Gothic is the dimension of time. How long will someone be taken to the shadows? For eternity? For a certain timeframe? As far as I know the religious lore of Gothic does not talk about eschatology. If this is correct, then this gap should be filled at least rudimentarily, because it is a necessity for religion, as far as I know from my personal analysis of all kinds of different religions, at least those considering god(s). It can be definitive (for example Christianity), it can be circular (for example Germanic paganism) but there is always an eschatology. 
    * Delvin: 11.09.2024:  darkness not necessarily should be associated with something grim/hell, at least not by everyone, it can also be associated with peace, eternal dream (Shagrad is associated with dreams as well as other things), etc., especially for people who had quite a rough life.


* Add to Cult of the Three Gods in Phoenix section:
    * Delvin: 11.09.2024: I like the idea that the cult of the three gods emerged only because of "unification" of the three gods into one cult, which was done to make sure that there is only one force which dictates the rules (the empire), which would reduce the potential religious conflicts, and not because many wanted to worship this deity, this added a lot depth to the lore.
    * Mention the Inquisition in the context of the three god cult, as described in the "founding of the empire document (or the part below that, that we wrote in google), and add Delvin who arrived at the very same conclusion: 
        Delvin, 11.09.2024: "maybe the inquisition, would be somehow associated with Beliar, since they and the black guards are like punishers. / This way, the empire would make Beliar's "persona" more useful for them, apart from the burying the dead."



---

Questions to ask:
* How do the people of Myrtana perceive Beliar?
* How do the people perceive primary Beliar followers him instead?
* What are the implications for the few people who are only venerating Beliar, doing that in a wrong way of course and to gain power over death and demons?
