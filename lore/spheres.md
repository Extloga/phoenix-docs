![Medieval Spheres](/_img/lore/spheres4.jpg)

In the World of Gothic there is the concept of different spheres. The here and now, the sphere of the living, is described as *Morgrad* in the book *Astronomie* [G]. The Demonworld was an early concept which in the alpha plot was supposed to appear in form of a couple of explorable level sections but had no dedicated name. To add the 'astral' as a third sphere concept was an idea by Dmitriy based on hints found in books of the mages as well as handwritten design documents. The names, other than Morgrad, come from me and are based on my writings about the old language. 


## Spheres in Phoenix

* **Morgrad: The Mortal(s) World** *Morgrad* is our "reality", the sphere of realisation; it's the world of the mortal, of those who came from the earth and will become earth when they die; the world of the living sharing their mortality. It is the world of embodiment; the world of the physical forms, the realisation of potential. A world of choices made, of paths taken, words spoken, deeds done.  
* **Shagrad: The Demon World** *Shagrad* is the world of the unrealised, the world of power and potential, of what could have been and can become. The world of the "demons" and "ghosts", of the ancestors, of the invisible and the imaginery. It is the world of dreams and nightmares. The world of the psychic, the subconscious, of desires and fears; an ocean of representations underneath reality. 
* **Tyrgrad: The Astral world** *Tyrgrad* is the abstract world of truth beyond the constant realisation and the source both of reality and of the ocean underneath; in metaphorical language of the mystics it is the mirror reflecting RA in everyone who clears the ocean by "releasing" (read dissolving/integrating) the demons. 

Our etymology of those terms is explained in our [moraic etymology]().
