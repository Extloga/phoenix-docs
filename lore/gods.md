## Gods of Myrtana

*Flosha, 09.09.2024 - 10.09.2024*

*About the Gods* [S]:
> *Innos der Gott des Feuers und des Gesetzes.*  
> *Wahrer der Ordnung.*  
> *Adanos Gott des Wassers und der Gerechtigkeit.*  
> *Waagschale der Menschheit.*  
> *Beliar Gott des Todes und der Dunkelheit.*  
> *Herrscher der Nacht.*  
> *Zusammen bilden sie die gÃ¶ttliche Dreifaltigkeit.*  
> *Den Ursprung der Welt, ihren Weg und ihr Ende.*  

I will at first deal with the gods based on the source material and in form of loose historical and etymological reflections. From our source material as listed in the [introduction to our lore](/lore/lore), we know the following names of gods:  

* *Ra* [C] and *Innos* [G]
* *Beliar* [G] aka *Vandras* [A] & *Kasakk* [N]
* *Adanos* [G] aka *Adrastos* [A] & *Cyvanis* [A]

Mike came up with the gods. One of the names from Mikes original gods was *Ra*, and maybe *Adanos* or *Adrastos* too, while *Innos*, *Vandras*, *Beliar* and *Cyvanis* (and perhaps *Adanos*) were suggestions from Filler - he made a list of potential names. One of the original names by Mike may have been lost. We do not know for sure who suggested which name, nor does Mike remember.

> Innos, Adanos and Beliar came later from Filler. And one of these three names was one of mine, but I do not remember which one. [...] I believe Innos I had called RA before.

It was Mattias Filler (the most important story-writer responsible for the main plot besides Stefan Nyul and Mike), who came up with the final names of the Gods, at least in case of *Innos* and *Beliar*, because he did not like the original names from Mike. The one name that may have been an original suggestion by Mike, might be Adanos, which was either among Mikes original suggestions or has been slightly changed by Filler from a formerly suggested *Adrastos* into Adanos. But it also could have been Beliar. 

> Mattias came to me and said: "The names of the gods are crap, we need to redo them..." So he did. [Mike Hoge, interview with Dmitriy, 30.12.20](https://gothicarchive.org/postrelease/interviews/MikeHoge_30_12_2020.html)


### Innos and Ra

*Flosha, 09.09.2024*

**Innos**: I speculate that Filler may have developed it by taking the word sun in German (*Sonne*), turning it around into *Ennos* and then just replacing the E by an I, because it sounded better; with the intention to replace *Ra* due to its historical connotation, while keeping the association with the sun. But we could also interpret it as being derived from "innocence"; absence of guilt, inability or absence of intention to harm. Latin *in* ("not") + *nocens* from *noceo* (to hurt); being innocent means "not to hurt", very much like the sanskrit *Ahimsa* (which means *non-harm*, most often translated as *non-violence*). 

Innos was not meant to be just "good", just as Beliar was not simply meant to be "evil"; Innos is order, Beliar is chaos, but they both are needed, they are all "part of the equation" (Mike). 

> *I am the rising sun, the light, and the life*

**Ra**: The name just means *sun* in ancient Egypt, where *Ra* was the God of the sun and the creator, of which most of the other gods were thought to be descended from. The Pharaos claimed themselves to be descendants of Ra by which they justified their rule; which is exactly what Rhobar II. is doing according to the Comic. 

In Gothic, Ra is only mentioned in the Comic, where Rhobar II. is described as... 
> [...] *the proclaimer of the faith into the three gods and representative of the highest god Ra* [C]

He is characterised here as the highest god, while the "three" gods of the myrtanian cult are also mentioned. Ra can either be meant to be one of these three, just the highest of them. Or he could be thought of as a divine absolute standing above and beyond the three gods. We can think of *Ra* as another name, an older name for *Innos* (which it most likely was) and as to be [identified with each other](#identification-of-innos-with-ra), but we can also imagine him as a god on his own. The one source that would suggest them being based on two different concepts, are the [four symbols](#ancient-symbols-of-the-gods) from the ancient temple.


#### Ancient Symbols of the Gods

```
OtWaMaskSun.tga, OtWaMaskFire.tga, OtWaMaskWater.tga, OtWaMaskMoon.tga
```

*Avallach:* In the Ancient Temple there are four stones with symbols, which we associate with the gods. A golden or yellow 8-armed star or sun for Ra, a red or orange flame for Innos, a purple moon for Beliar and a blue droplet for Adanos.

### Beliar, Vandras or Kasakk

*Flosha, 09.09.2024*

Beliar - also known as *Vandras* from an earlier version of the *Lore of the Gods* and as *Kasakk* in the novel - is the god of the death, god of darkness, creator of the night, responsible for punishment and the shadows. He is not meant to just be "the evil", nor was Innos meant to just be "the good". 

> Mike: This was also one of those internal conflicts. [...] "He will go to Beliars realm" does not mean to go to hell, but just to go into the realm of the dead, was my original idea. That is what I wanted to have. [Mike, 30.01.2021](https://gothicarchive.org/postrelease/interviews/MikeHoge_30_01_2021_Part3.html#Mythology)
 
**Beliar**: *Belial* or *Beliar* are Hebrew and speculated to stem from two roots, which mean as much as "without" and "to be useful" or "of value", resulting in a literal meaning of "worthlessness", "uselessness" or "ruin". It has also been interpreted as "never to rise", like a downward movement or "wicked". In the scriptures, Beliar is used as a general phrase of despise. A "son of Beliar" is just a characterisation as "a worthless, wicked, useless" man. 

In the Talmud it is explained as "without the yoke" or "yokeless". In this context we have to think of *yoga*, which also means *yoke*, in the sense of *union* or *unification* (of life, just as the yoke unites two bulls); Beliar would then be the opposite, the *Disuniter*, ayoga; which again we could interpret in a metaphysical sense in the context of a disjunction of body and soul upon death, for which Beliar is responsible. 

> In my idea of the lore it has always been so, that this God-Satan story does not exist in the religious world of Gothic, but all the gods were important. And there were specific attributes ascribed to them. And insofar it should be the so that Beliar too had his followers. [Mike, 30.01.2021](https://gothicarchive.org/postrelease/interviews/MikeHoge_30_01_2021_Part3.html#4Temple)

In one of the Dead Sea scrolls, titled *The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness*, Belial is characterised as "the leader of the Sons of Darkness", which are also described as the *army of Belial*. 

> You made Belial for the pit, angel of enmity; in darkness is his domain, his counsel is to bring about wickedness and guilt. All the spirits of his are angels of destruction, they walk in the laws of darkness; towards it goes their only desire. 

In the "Rules of the Community", Belial is described to control a large number of demons, but demons which are *"specifically allotted to him by God for the purpose of performing evil"*. Belial is here *"established as the force occupying the opposite end of the specrtrum of God"*. 

In the *Fragments*, Belial is *"sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel"*. In the fragments it is also written that..

> *anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a necromancer and a wizard*. 

It is unclear why Beliar was not given up as a name for the same reasons as Ra may have been given up, due to so many real-life religious implications. I can only assume that apparently they liked these implications as much that it justified keeping the name.  

Belial also plays an important role in modern occultism such as in the writings of Aleister Crowly in *Goetia* (1904). In *The Book of Belial* (one of the four books of the so called *Satanic Bible* by Anton LaVey), the name is explained to mean "without a master" (like the word anarchy), and symbolises "independence, self-sufficiency, and personal accomplishment". In this sense, he is like a god of anarchy. 

As to where the name may have been taken from: If not from the original historical sources listed above: Mike mentioned in interviews that he was inspired by *Dungeon Keeper* from 1997. In the expansion *The Deeper Dungeons*, *Belial* is the name of the final level. Filler may have known this too. Beliar is also mentioned in *Paradise Lost*, the epic poem by John Milten. And "Paradise Lost" is one of the names in the list by Dieter Hildebrandt of potential names for Gothic.

**Vandras**: In Sanskrit, *vandra* means to praise, to worship. Based on *vandra* from Old Norse *vondr*, meaning wander or roam, it could mean as much as the "wanderer". *Van* in Sanskrit has the meaning of "sound", but also "to serve" and "to honour", but also "to be distressed". *Vanaya* means "to act", "to hurt", "to kill". It could also be speculated to be somehow related to the *Vandals*, which in a moderng meaning, in the sense of "vandalism", are associated with destruction due to their sack of Rome in 455. Since about the 17th century during the Enlightenment, the Romans were idealised and the Goths and Vandals were blamed for the fall of Rome. In the *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, *vandal* has been described as "willful destroyer of what is beautiful or venerable". Etymologically it may also be derived from the Proto-germanic root *wand-* (water). See Old English *wendelsÇ£* or Old High German *wentilsÄo* (meaning vandal-sea - the mediterranean sea). Also *Vendras*, spanish for "you will come", from *venir* (to come). Or Romanian *vandras*, "a tramp".  

By summarising all of these findings and by putting all of those meanings together in a way that serves the lore, we could characterise Beliar/Vandras to be a vagrant, always wandering god, who wants to be worshipped and will bring destruction and distress when not being praised, when not being accepted, when not followed during his wandering into the night and as such a wanderer he may be well associated with the moon; he is the disuniter who brought the night and death as a necessity of life. See [lore of the gods](#lore-of-the-gods) for more.  

---

**Kasakk**: Sanskrit *kasakka*, "tie firmly". *Kazakh* was speculated to originate from the fusion of different clans, such as "Khaz" and "Sak". *Kaz* or *kas* means "free", "brave" and "man" in all turkic languages. In our moraic and orcish etymology, "ak" means as much as "from" or "descending from". Kasakk could in this sense mean as much as a "free descendant".  

*This part about Kasakk is written by Avallach:*

**Kasakk** is only mentioned in the Gothic Novel (*Sleeper's Ban*), and he is the *only* deity that is mentioned there. He appears to be the deity of the realm of the dead, similarly to Beliar from the game. 

> [...] *until they go to Kasakk's realm at some point, simply because they forget to eat or breathe or drink or whatever.*

Despite being a dark god, he appears to be the only one worshipped by people in the story, drawing parallel with *Crom* from the universe of *Conan the Barbarian*.

> *"In Kasakk's name, leave me alone please!"*  
> [...] *"thank Kasakk they are not organized."*  
> *"He really deserved it, in Kasakk's name."*  
> *"Kasakk put copper on the eyes of three of our men."* [they died]  
> [...] *"by Kasakk's stinking heap!*"  
> *"For Kasakk's sake, let's get out of here."*  
> *"Kasakk, Kasakk? Right, there was this little god, I remember."*  


### Adanos, Adrastos or Cyvanis

*Flosha, 09.09.2024*

Adanos is the god of balance, he stands for healing, work, knowledge, curiosity, courage and is represented by water. This aspect of "balance" between the two forces of Innos and Beliar, like the water that fills up evenly without distinction, always horizontal, always flowing down, was among Mikes original ideas. 

Innos brought light, Beliar brought the night. Both brought life that couldn't exist without them both, according to the [lore of the gods](#lore-of-the-gods). Beliar brought death, the negation of life. And Adanos, inbetween, brought healing. 

> *Adanos saw, that the humans were dying and that it was the will of Beliar. And he said: I will not stand against the will of Beliar, but I will give humankind the power of healing.* [G]


**Adanos**: Sanskrit *Ada* has several different pronounciations, all coming with a different meaning: 

> Ada, eating, devouring.  
> ÄdÄ* means "to receive, accept, take, resort to, seize, take hold of", also "to imprison".   
> Äá¸a (à¤à¤¡).âf An obstinate resisting or insisting upon: also a point maintained of opposition or difficulty.  
> ada (à¤à¤¦).âa Half.  
> adÄ (à¤à¤¦à¤¾).âm The airs and arts of coquetry. Fund. Income.  

TODO: Also look up *Adonis*, *adenoid*.

Also see *anos* (years, age) and "ad"? Sanskrit *adhi* "near", latin *ad* "to, toward"; from this also Old English "aet", or modern English "at". *Ad-anos* would then mean as much as "near time", "at the time", "at the age", which could be interpreted as the god of the presence or the god of time. 

> "ad- Motion or direction to; reduction or change into; addition, increase, or intensification."

Also see *ada*+*nos*. *Nos*, latin "we, us". *Adhah*, sanskrit "down, under, below", from there *Adhara*, "ground, foundation" and *Adhana*, sanskrit "without possessions". Ada+nos could then be something like "below us", "under us", or "the foundation of us" or "we without any possession" or whatever. 

In Hebrew, *Adha* means "ornament". 

**Adrastos**: Greek mythology, á¼Î´ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï ("Adrastus") may mean "the inescapable". A king of Argos. Adrastus was mentioned in the *Iliad* of Homer and has been depicted in art already in the 6th century BC; there is too much to write about him, but not much that seems relevant for the god in question.  

**Cyvanis**: [TODO]

## Lore of the Gods

An ingame book in Gothic consisting of three volumes.  
Below we will quote the entire book with a very short analysis of what it implies. 

A more elaborated commentary with an interpretation of the texts is given in the Phoenix Section. 
{: .subtext }

> HÃ¶re die Worte der GÃ¶tter, denn es ist ihr Wille, dass sie gehÃ¶rt werden. Befolge die Lehren der GÃ¶tter, denn es ist ihr Wille, dass sie befolgt werden. Achte die Priester der GÃ¶tter, denn sie sind erwÃ¤hlt.

The first volume is more moral in character, the second volume deals with the creation of the world and life and the third volume establishes the superiority of priesthood and talks of the "fall of magic". From this general layout we can deduce a primarily moral intention and focus of the scripture.  

It seems that mythological and historical records are melting together in the books, alongside a ideological colouration of the author, which can be speculated to be a priest of fire based on his negative description of the circle of water, of which he writes that they *"... directed their prayers to Adanos and forgot their origin"*. 

It is also important to notice, that inspite of the authors ideological bias against the Adanos cult, he clearly demands in Volume I to "follow the will of the gods" in plural and to respect the priests in general, which includes the priests of Adanos. 

Due to these characteristics we can deduce that the book was written during the time of Rhobar I. or II. (which we summarise as the "New Empire"), after the reconciliation of the house of Innos and the house of Adanos under Rhobar.


### The Will of the Gods

*Flosha, 13.06.2024*

> Die Worte Innos: Und mÃ¶get ihr nicht verstehen, so zweifelt nicht an den Worten der Priester, ihr Tun ist gerecht und weise. Denn ich bin die aufgehende Sonne, das Licht und das Leben. Und alles was da wider der Sonne, ist wider mir und soll verbannt sein auf immer und ewig in die Schatten.  
> Die Worte Adanos: Arbeite und lebe, denn der Tag ist gemacht dafÃ¼r, dass der Mensch arbeite. Suche das Lernen und Wissen, auf dass Du es weitergeben kannst, denn so bist Du geschaffen worden. Wer aber mÃ¼Ãig und faul, der soll verbannt werden auf immer und ewig in die Schatten.  
> Die Worte Beliars: Wer aber handelt unrecht und gegen den Willen der GÃ¶tter, den will ich strafen, den KÃ¶rper mit Schmerz, Leid und Tod, den Geist werde ich aber zu mir nehmen auf immer und ewig in die Schatten. [G]

Summarising the words of the gods, the first volume is stating that Innos and Adanos want those to be banished into the shadows who act against them. The words of Beliar are not in any kind of conflict with the words of Innos or Adanos, but are confirming them: 

> "But who acts unrighteous and against the will of the gods, he I shall punish."

This characterises Beliar as the god of execution (of justice) and death. He is a dark god, not an evil god. And that is how Mike had conceptualised him. 


### The first Appropriation of Magic
or: The Great Disentchantment

*Flosha & logx, 28.07.2020*

> Innos gab den Menschen die Macht ihn zu hÃ¶ren und zu ihm zu sprechen. Er gab ihnen die Macht groÃe Wunder zu vollbringen. Und er nannte sie Magie. Mit dieser Macht konnten die Menschen die Welt frei nach ihrem Willen gestalten. Es gab keine Grenzen, die Innos ihnen aufzeigte. Und so hatten die Menschen Teil an der gÃ¶ttlichen SchÃ¶pferkraft. Aber die Menschen waren sich alle gleich und das gefiel ihnen nicht. Also nahm er denen die unzufrieden waren, die Kraft. Die wenigen, die sich dankbar zeigten, stellte Innos Ã¼ber alle anderen.    
> Diese Menschen wurden alsbald verehrt und gefÃ¼rchtet und wurden Priester genannt. [G]

[TODO: Translate the section below]

Die Menschen glauben, dass Ra (bzw. Innos, die sie mit ihm identifizieren) den ersten Menschen, die unsterblich waren, die Magie als einen Teil seiner gÃ¶ttlichen SchÃ¶pferkraft gab und dass sie - Kraft der Magie - nahezu gÃ¶ttliche FÃ¤higkeiten zur Gestaltung der Welt hatten. 

Doch der Mythos erzÃ¤hlt, dass sich die Menschen als unwÃ¼rdig erwiesen, weil sie sich alle gleich waren (BedÃ¼rfnis nach IndividualitÃ¤t, DiversitÃ¤t, Ãberlegenheit, Unterschied), so dass Innos den UnwÃ¼rdigen seine Macht (die Magie) wieder entzog und dass er einige wenige als Herrscher Ã¼ber alle anderen stellte: Die Priester.  
Gewisse ketzerische Bewegungen betrachten diesen Teil des Mythos als LÃ¼gen der Priester, um ihre eigene Macht zu legitimieren und den Ausschluss aller anderen von der Magie zu rechtfertigen.

Herrschaft, Gesetz, Licht und Feuer werden traditionell Ra zugeschrieben. Unter der FÃ¼hrung jener damals noch nicht gespaltenen Priester grÃ¼ndeten diese ersten Menschen, von denen die Ãberlieferung spricht, ein mÃ¤chtiges Reich (das "erste Reich"): dessen Zentrum das heutige Varant. Als Insignie der unumschrÃ¤nkten Herrschaft Ã¼ber die StÃ¤mme von Varant und die Welt trug der oberste Priester des Ersten Reiches einen Stab mit angeblich gÃ¶ttlichen KrÃ¤ften zur Beherrschung der SphÃ¤ren. Man nennt ihn spÃ¤ter das "Zepter von Varant".


### Cultic Wars & the Decline of Faith

*Flosha, 25.03.2024*

> ... wurden Priester genannt. Doch auch unter ihnen gab es viele, die bald unzufrieden waren. Und so kam es, dass sie zu Adanos beteten und ihren Ursprung vergaÃen. Die Riege der Priester war gespalten. Kriege wurden entfesselt und auch der Glaube an die gÃ¶ttliche Allmacht war bald schon nur noch Mythos. So teilten sich die Priester. Die dem Adanos folgten nannte man nun Magier des Wassers, die Geweihten des Innos hieÃen aber die Magier des Feuers. [G]

The scripture informs us that cultic wars were started in course of the split of the priests and that apparently the belief in the allmightiness of god became a myth.  
We can interpret this to suggest that atheism and other faiths gained popularity.  
Rhobar I. took measures against this decline of faith and the cultic disputes with the proclamation of the faith in the three gods, in order to reconcile the houses of Innos and Adanos and by acquiring the Sceptre of Varant, claiming himself to be the governor of the highest god RA, identified with Innos, in order to set himself into a lineage of the old realm.  
Rhobar II. later established the Inquisition as another measure, as a representation of Beliars justice. 


## Cults of Myrtana

Within Myrtana, "religion" (a word that should not appear anywhere ingame) is practiced in form of *Cults* in the sense of the cults of antiquity, such as the mystery cults of ancient Greece. Accordingly, in the Gothic lore there are no "churches" in Myrtana, but temples. 

We may mention though that "cathedrals" are mentioned in the context of Gothic. A cathedral was among the very first things that were designed when the Mad Scientists and the founders of the later Piranha Bytes joined to work on what would later become Gothic and there is an associating music track too. But we should not confuse this internal (or even in-universe) term as to connote something very christian; the "cathedral" is primarily used because it is such an important gothic trope; it is of threatening, awe-inspiring and iconic character and when thinking of gothic fiction, a dark, gothic cathedral is among the first things that come to mind. So it was obvious to imagine and work on a cathedral. 
{: .subtext }

There is a cult of Innos, a cult of Adanos and a cult of Beliar. There may be other cults too, but these are the prevailing ones. Myrtana under the rule of Rhobar II. propagates the *Cult of the Three Gods*. The myrtanian people believe in the three gods and in their role in the grand scheme of life, at some places the worship of Innos may prevail, while at other places, more followers of Adanos are to be found. But no devotee of one of the gods would negate the existence of another. 

There are also other local deities and believes in different corners of the realm, such as the shamanism of the orcs and specific movements considered as heretical by the priests, such as the *Brotherhood of the Sleeper*. 


### Cult of the Three Gods

*Flosha, 13.06.2024*

> *"the proclaimer of the faith into the three gods and representative of the highest god Ra"* [C]

According to the Comic, Rhobar II. (perhaps Rhobar I. already) established this new faith, the cult of the three gods in Myrtana, while Innos or Ra - which at least in the present are used interchangeably - is seen as the highest god of the three. Rhobars proclamation of the faith into the three gods can thus be seen both as a reconciliation (after the cultic wars), but also, by establishing Innos as the highest god, he clearly decided the war in favour of Innos.

Just as Innos and Adanos, Beliar has dedicated followers too, but according to the sources, it seems that no sacrifices are offered to him and no public worship is taking place; if there is any cultic practice of the followers of Beliar, then it seems to be done in secrecy, since the worship of Beliar is condemned by the priests. While there are priests of Innos and Adanos, the manual specifically mentions - and also Mike said so at some point, that there are no priests of Beliar and the magic assigned to Beliar, such as necromancy or the summoning of demons, is banned and considered heretical.

> [...] zu oberst stand *Innos*, der Gott der Sonne und des Gesetzes, der als erster und hÃ¶chster Gott verehrt wurde und dessen Priester die Magier des Feuers waren. Die
Priester des Gottes *Adanos* [...] waren die Magier des Wasserkreises, nur dem
Gott der Dunkelheit und des Todes, *Beliar*, waren keine Priester geweiht, denn seine MÃ¤chte waren von finsterer Natur. [M]

Also the *Lore of the Gods* at least implies, that no priests may be consecrated to Beliar, as they are not mentioned. So according to the sources there may indeed be no priests of beliar - at least not anymore at the time during which the story takes place. And at least not where the myrtanian regime is in control. In the colony, they are not...

The "clergy" of Myrtana is thus divided into the priests of fire and the priests of water (which are organised in *circles*), while as a whole, as the communities of followers, they are described as the "House of Innos" and the "House of Adanos". Similar to what in Christianity would be described as the Roman-Catholic or Protestant or Orthodox Church etc. Just that here they were reconciled in form of the faith into the three Gods, something like an ecumenical movement of Myrtana (although less peaceful, but a brutal, a gothic one). Both in Gothic and the Sequel the followers of Innos are also described as the *Children of Fire*. 

The belief in the gods, while it may be in decline (and the reverence especially for Innos may be the lowest in a place like the colony), is still very popular within Myrtana and we can quote several mentionings within the game(s).

> *The Mages in the New Camp are planning something with the magical barrier. The Gods may protect us.* (Secret Thieves, 0.56c)

> *Today I will succeed. I know it. The Gods help me. [...] Today I will kill a troll.* [G]

> Rigaldo: *May Innos protect us.* [G]

> Until my body goes to Beliars realm and extinguishing is the fire of life. [G]
<!--> Arbeiter: Dieses Diebespack, diese faulen Hunde, soll Beliar sie alle holen! [S]-->
> Worker: *This pack of thieves, those lazy dogs, shall Beliar take them all!* [S]

<!-- > Brief eines Arbeiters *Bei Innos, die Orks haben schreckliche Dinge mit ihnen getan.* / *Innos sei Dank, zumindest haben wir es ins Lager geschafft. Der KÃ¶nig ist ebenfalls hier im Tal. Das gibt vielen hier Mut und Kraft.* -->
> Letter of a worker: *Oh Innos, the orcs have done terrible things to them.* / *Thank Innos, at least we made it into the camp.*
<!-- Magic is still thought to be a gift of the gods; even if it cannot be proven. A title of a book that was not written, is talking of the "Divine Gift" (GÃ¶ttergabe), related to the first circle, refering to magic or the "Arcane". There is a melee weapon called "GÃ¶tterhammer" (hammer of the gods). -->


### Sect of the Sleeper

We will deal with the sect in the faction documentation. For here it has to suffice to note, that the entrance into the sect is accompanied by a radical and conscious renunciation of the three gods, that they also call the "old gods". 

> Ich habe den alten GÃ¶ttern abgeschworen. [G]

> Novice: Pray for the last time to your gods. [A]

The priests of the cult still assume that their magical (psionic) power has to have a source in some kind of god, because they do not know or cannot imagine a magic unrelated to a higher, divine (or demonic) source, as magic is seen as a gift from the gods. 

> [...] The brotherhood is a threat. A threat for the proceeding of our trade agreement and thus for the King, the entire kingdom and also for your life. Therefore you should send out scouts and find out, on which gods and on which knowledge their magical power is based. If you figured this out, we will inform the priests of your findings, so that together we can bring an end to this phantom. [...] [G]



## Phoenix Solutions

TODO:
* Take out most interpretation above to put here.
* Take out all the phoenix related historical context (first empire etc.)
* Add all the additional ideas from our discord exchanges.
* Maybe put the interpretation of the scriptures here; but instead add a summary of all the stuff that can clearly be taken without interpretation from all the sources, although the current interpretation of the lore of the gods imo is quite obvious
{: .subtext }


### Gods in Phoenix

```
TODO: Innos and Beliar - any summaries/additions/explanations beyond what is written in the Alpha analyses?
```

Adanos was associated in the scriptures with diversity (which we interpret as different tribes, cultures, nations), with knowledge (which we interpret as the development of self-consciousness and intellect), with curiosity (which we interpret as the driving force of exploration) and with courage (which we interpret as to conquer and rule the world (nature) "given" to them). At the same time he was associated in the Sequel with justice. 


#### Beyond Good & Evil

In the manual and also at some places in the design documentation, the writers used to fall back into a simplified good/evil dichotomy. But to do the early ideas justice (or just in order to tell a better story, a more meaningful drama), it is very important to us neither to see Innos and Beliar as representing good and evil, nor to confuse the role of Adanos accordingly, as a balance between good and evil.

Adanos should be about a more complex form of balance as in the philosophy of yin & yang, that are both necessary; a clear good/evil dichotomy should be avoided at all costs. Innos and Beliar are indeed about a duality, a duality like light and dark, of activity & passivity, of giving and receiving; but they are both *needed* and form a "unity of opposites". 

Just as the ancient indian cults of the gods as all these aspects of Brahman, the Absolute, is hard to grasp for the western mind and widely misunderstood as a "polytheism", yin & yang, while about a duality, are not about a contrast of mutually exclusive forces, they are one, the two sides of a coin or a wheel (think of the wheel of the dharma). And it is Adanos who lets the wheel roll, taking care that it doesn't fall unto one of the sides. 

If the documentation says otherwise, then we see this as a regression for simplicity's sake in the context of the internal design docs, that Mike had wanted to avoid to present as such in the game; and in any way has to be avoided by us, due to our [definition of Gothic](/vision/gothic-defined). 


#### The Divine Law

All of the three gods are associated in the sources with justice, but in different ways.
Innos is associated specifically with the *law*. Beliar is associated with punishment (of those who act against the will of the gods), he is therefore associated with the *execution* of the law. And Adanos is associated with *justice* in the Sequel, but in a sense of balance, of equality (in case of unjust inequality). 


#### Gods in Relation to Men

*Flosha, Hagen & Delvin*  
*11.09.2024 - 15.09.2024*

In order to design the gods in Phoenix in a coherent way and get a better picture of their role in the kingdom and their *meaning* for the people in Myrtana, we should try to imagine in which cases, for which themes, problems and so on, they turn and pray to which god. Or in other words: How gods and men relate. 

Because by believing in different gods they clearly imagine the gods to have different responsibilities and may be seen as patrons of different professions and estates. So we asked the question: For what purposes and in which situations will people pray to or worship the gods, including Beliar?


| Gods       | Areas of Life |
|------------|---------------|
| **Innos**  | light, sun, fire, day, war, fighting, sports, power & fortune, law (legislation), bad dreams (dispelling darkness), weather (spending sun for agriculture, spare from fire, thunder and cold), vices (like addiction), theocracy (and kritarchy?), monarchy(?), sound & speech, vibration(?), trade, procreation, language, the spoken word, work, activity |
| **Adanos** | water, health (spare from sickness, heal wounds, ease pain), justice (judiciary), equality (and measuring), travel, weather (send enough rain, spare from floods), meritocracy/noocracy (?), republic (?), fertility, dexterity (craft-related), learning, the written word |
| **Beliar** | night, darkness, silence, death (gentle death, delaying death, fear of death), moon, executive, fear, dreams (imagination), hiding, curses, revenge, retribution, miscarriage, shady business, occultism, anarchy (as well as autocracy on the opposite spectrum, or kraterocracy), rest, inactivity, demons (protect from & evoke), ghosts, sorrow, harvest, the unspoken, hidden thoughts |

As discussed in [divine law](#the-divine-law), we associate Innos with the aspect of "legislation" (giving of the law) and therefore legislators, Adanos with the "judiciary" and therefore judges (in the particular meaning mentioned above - the royal magistrates of the New Empire are Innos focused) and Beliar with the executive and thus executioners.

Innos is associated with and responsible for light, creation, the sun and its warmth, thus the people of Myrtana pray to him for everything related. That the sun may shine and protect them from cold (hard winter - disfavour of Innos), that the fire of the home may never extinguish, that no fire may break out in or lightnings struck the village, that light might fill their thoughts (overcome vice), dreams (no nightmares) and bodies (in form of children, as creation is associated with Innos and light, with which children - below a certain age - are associated too).  
Accordingly, those professions that are working with fire a lot, use to turn to and are traditionally associated with Innos, but also those crafts which "create" the basic structures of their cultural world (builders). As he is associated with law and order, so he is with order and structure in general.  
Since he is thought to have given men the ability to see, to speak and to hear and "enlightened" the related senses, we associate him with music, the spoken word, singing, poetry and language in general as well as those professions which are primary driven by communication, such as trade.  
As he is also associated with war he is of course revered by all kinds of warriors. 

Adanos is associated with water and healing; so he is with health and all related professions. They pray to him that they may stay healthy or become healthy again, that wounds may heal, that it may rain enough, with fertility of the soil (and women), with floods that the people hope to be spared from, with travel, travelers and innkeepers (just as Adanos carries the waters safely through rivers to the sea and is always in motion) and naturally with all professions dealing with water.  
Due to his association with equality and the water as a measure and its evenness, he is also associated with measures in general and revered by those who experience inequality, such as slaves and beggars.  
And due to his relation with knowledge he is associated with science, the written word (which connects the world of thoughts to the manifested) and all kinds of scholars.  
And due to his association with curiosity and diversity, he is also associated with the finer arts and crafts, such as painting (water) or weaving, as well as with those who produce variety in form of tailors (individual clothes) or dyers. 

Beliar is associated with the night, the shadows, the moon, with dreams, the imaginative, and with death and demons. So he is revered by all who deal with death (hangmen, gravediggers), with those who operate at night and those who hide. Thieves and the haunted, those who try to escape or those involved in shady business. He is prayed to by those who seek revenge; those who are cursed or want to curse; those who are afraid or want others to fear them; those who are in sorrow or completely abandoned or banned. He is also associated with harvest due to its traditional associations. As Innos is associated with the spoken, Adanos with the written word, so is Beliar with the unspoken, unwritten, with all hidden thoughts, feelings and ideas, and with silence. He is associated with occultism (in the sense of dark, hidden practices) as well as with anarchy and chaos. And - very importantly - he is associated with mining, as the miners work in the dark, seeking for hidden ore (literally "stars of the earth" in the old language) in the shadows.

Gods and Time/Cycles:
As Innos and Beliar are seen to be responsible for day and night, the day and night cycle is seen as a constant flow between the dominance of these two aspects. Allegorically the sun may be seen as being born at dawn and wins over the darkness. That the darkness is just there to reveal the light, for it to "stand out" (which is the literal meaning of existence). The night may be seen as a veil thrown over the world at dusk to bring silence.  
Dawn is like the rise of Innos, Dusk like his conscious retraction. Innos and the day are associated with activity and work, while the night for most people is associated with inactivity and rest - but just as important.  
Adanos could be imagined as playing a role in the transition inbetween; as if he helps at dusk and dawn (imagine the image of the sun rising at the horizon from the water at dawn or sinking down into the earth at dusk), Adanos playing a mediator role or being responsible for this exchange to bring balance. 

In this way, Adanos may also be associated with time and *change* in general. For the magic in our universe and our understanding of the *Elementary Arcanum*, this may play an important role, as water may have to be involved in any kind of change including movement and transmission.

| God        | Professions/Estates |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Innos**  | warriors, soldiers, legislators - "lawyers", smiths, gladiators, mercenaries, merchants, cooks (herd), masons, carpenters, charcoal burners, bakers, bards, poets, musicians, priests, potters, nightwatchmen, children |
| **Adanos** | healers (medici, surgeons, midwifes), judges (in the sense of mediators), slaves (gladiators too), fishermen, travelers (also traveling merchants), innkeepers, explorers, hunters, shepherds, peasants, sailors, ferrymen, scholars, artists, spinners, weavers, tailors, beggars, beekeepers, potters, dyers, priests | 
| **Beliar** | gravediggers, executioners, miners, gladiators (fast/heroic death), butchers, knackers, criminals (everyone in hiding: thieves, refugees, scared, haunted), nightwatchmen, whores, priests |

As can be seen, some professions or estates we linked to two or all the three gods, depending on the perspective and the situation. A potter deals with water as much as with fire. A nightwatchmen carries fire through the night, but may also hope for the moon to appear. A gladiator may pray to Innos for victory in battle, to Beliar for a merciful death in case of loss, to Adanos if he is a slave who hopes for freedom. 

It should be obvious, that the assignment of the professions is only meant to be a general tendency and a traditional association; there can be several reasons for why one may prefer and pray to another god for particular, individual reasons.

<!-- What is the name of these sort of judges in villages like in Afghanistan etc. who mediate between the people? Those is what I imagine adanos "judges" to mean; opposed to royal judges who are more about the flame and thereby kind of taking the role of judgement out of the hands of the adanos judges, where - as they may say - it was in better hands -> they are more operating according to the Dao-de-Jing and Laotse/Daoism: Add this to the law/justice section! 

Trade: Trading has lots to do with communication; Innos gave men the ability to speek, so we have assigned it primarily to Innos.

#### Identification of Innos with Ra

*flosha, based on ideas by Avallach*

We combine both of the above mentioned possible explanations regarding Ra & and Innos (Ra as the former name of Innos and being identified with him, as well as Ra as the actual divine Absolute that the other three gods originated from), by explaining it through a historical, religious development within Myrtana. 

We imagine *Innos* as a nordic god, which was primarily worshipped in the northern lands. He originated as a god of war, of law and fire. While *Ra* is a god originating from the ancient civilisation of Varant, the creator, with an emphasis on light, the sun and illumination. 

The "fire" comes both with the positive aspects of warmth and its essential role in the cultural evolution, as well as with destructive aspects of destruction. In the context of justice, the fire is seen as "cleansing" and being "just" in that it burns everyone the same - unless he is *innocent* (in this context, think of the [*Feuerprobe*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feuerprobe)).

In the context of Innos as a god of war, see the sword of Gomez, called *Innos Zorn* ("Wrath" or "Rage" of Innos). In religious contexts there is the concept of "gerechter Zorn" (*just wrath*), that is often attributed to saints or god himself. It may be *Innos* who is thought to be *angry*, who wants rage; while Beliar is the one who is executing it in form of punishment in accordance with [Innos' will](#the-will-of-the-gods).

In the Sequel, Innos is specifically linked to the *law* and the *maintenance of order*, while Adanos is linked to *justice*, and called "Waagschale der Menschheit" (scale of mankind), not in the sense of weighing them, but in the sense of keeping mankind in balance between the two forces of light and darkness, order and chaos. 

In order to propagate the cult of fire (whose priests originated from the united priests of the ancient civilisation but split into different cults from there), the priests of fire have started to identify *Innos* with *Ra* in their preachings since a few centuries. But it was under the reign of Rhobar I. that this identification was brought to an end and that the two gods finally merged in the public perception. Rhobars establishment as a quasi divine ruler and the declaration of his realm as a successor of the first empire, proven by bearing the holy insignia (the Sceptre of Varant), was the final seal of this fusion. 

In course of this, the traditional aspects of *Innos*, of fire, law and war, have become the prevailing attributes in the general understanding of the god, while the aspects of *Ra* have experienced a decline. Among scholars who learned the older language, the old name *Ra* is still in use (as in the example of the royal judge in the Comic), but most often used interchangeably with *Innos*. A simple solution by which we do not have to explain the speech of the judge in the Comic as any mistake. 

But while the Cult of Myrtana identifies *Innos* with *Ra*, some heretical movements refuse this identification; similar to the gnostics they see *Innos*, as worshipped in the cult of the three gods, as a malevolent lesser god and demiurg in difference to the divine Absolute.


## Cult of Three Gods

With the founding of the empire, Rhobar I. attempted to reconcile the disputes of the priests by the proclamation of the faith in the three gods. There are other cults in the kingdom. But since Rhobar I. the *Cult of the Three Gods* is "states religion".
