## Gods of Myrtana

*Flosha, 09.09.2024 - 10.09.2024*

*About the Gods* [S]:
> *Innos der Gott des Feuers und des Gesetzes.*  
> *Wahrer der Ordnung.*  
> *Adanos Gott des Wassers und der Gerechtigkeit.*  
> *Waagschale der Menschheit.*  
> *Beliar Gott des Todes und der Dunkelheit.*  
> *Herrscher der Nacht.*  
> *Zusammen bilden sie die gÃ¶ttliche Dreifaltigkeit.*  
> *Den Ursprung der Welt, ihren Weg und ihr Ende.*  

I will at first deal with the gods based on the source material and in form of loose historical and etymological reflections. From our source material as listed in the [introduction to our lore](/lore/lore), we know the following names of gods:  

* *Ra* [C] and *Innos* [G]
* *Beliar* [G] aka *Vandras* [A] & *Kasakk* [N]
* *Adanos* [G] aka *Adrastos* [A] & *Cyvanis* [A]

Mike came up with the gods. One of the names from Mikes original gods was *Ra*, and maybe *Adanos* or *Adrastos* too, while *Innos*, *Vandras*, *Beliar* and *Cyvanis* (and perhaps *Adanos*) were suggestions from Filler - he made a list of potential names. One of the original names by Mike may have been lost. We do not know for sure who suggested which name, nor does Mike remember.

> Innos, Adanos and Beliar came later from Filler. And one of these three names was one of mine, but I do not remember which one. [...] I believe Innos I had called RA before.

It was Mattias Filler (the most important story-writer responsible for the main plot besides Stefan Nyul and Mike), who came up with the final names of the Gods, at least in case of *Innos* and *Beliar*, because he did not like the original names from Mike. The one name that may have been an original suggestion by Mike, might be Adanos, which was either among Mikes original suggestions or has been slightly changed by Filler from a formerly suggested *Adrastos* into Adanos. But it also could have been Beliar. 

> Mattias came to me and said: "The names of the gods are crap, we need to redo them..." So he did. [Mike Hoge, interview with Dmitriy, 30.12.20](https://gothicarchive.org/postrelease/interviews/MikeHoge_30_12_2020.html)


### Ra and Innos

*Flosha, 09.09.2024*

> *I am the rising sun, the light, and the life*

**Ra**: The name just means *sun* in ancient Egypt, where *Ra* was the God of the sun and the creator, of which most of the other gods were thought to be descended from. The Pharaos claimed themselves to be descendants of Ra by which they justified their rule; which is exactly what Rhobar II. is doing according to the Comic. 

In Gothic, Ra is only mentioned in the Comic, where Rhobar II. is described as... 
> [...] *the proclaimer of the faith into the three gods and representative of the highest god Ra* [C]

He is characterised here as the highest god, while the "three" gods of the myrtanian cult are also mentioned. Ra can either be meant to be one of these three, just the highest of them. Or he can be thought of as a divine absolute standing above and beyond the three gods. We can think of *Ra* as another name, an older name for *Innos* (which it most likely was) and as to be [identified with each other](#identification-of-innos-with-ra), but we can also imagine him as a god on his own. The one source that would suggest them being based on two different concepts, are the [four symbols](#ancient-symbols-of-the-gods) from the ancient temple. In Phoenix, we just combine both of these solutions. 

---

**Innos**: I speculate that Filler may have developed it by taking the word sun in German (*Sonne*), turning it around into *Ennos* and then just replacing the E by an I, because it sounded better; with the intention to replace *Ra* due to its historical connotation, while keeping the association with the sun. But we could also interpret it as being derived from "innocence"; absence of guilt, inability or absence of intention to harm. Latin *in* ("not") + *nocens* from *noceo* (to hurt); being innocent means "not to hurt", very much like the sanskrit *Ahimsa* (which means *non-harm*, most often translated as *non-violence*). 


#### Ancient Symbols of the Gods

```
OtWaMaskSun.tga, OtWaMaskFire.tga, OtWaMaskWater.tga, OtWaMaskMoon.tga
```

*Avallach:* In the Ancient Temple there are four stones with symbols, which we associate with the gods. A golden or yellow 8-armed star or sun for Ra, a red or orange flame for Innos, a purple moon for Beliar and a blue droplet for Adanos.

#### Identification of Innos with Ra

*flosha, based on ideas by Avallach*

We imagine *Innos* as a nordic god, which was worshipped in the northern lands. He originated as a god of war, focusing on the destructive aspects of fire, of burning, cleansing and being "just" in that it burns everyone the same - unless he is *innocent* (in this context, think of the [*Feuerprobe*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feuerprobe)); while *Ra* is a god originating from the ancient civilisation of Varant with an emphasis on light, the sun, illumination and fire in its positive role in the cultural evolution.

In the context of justice, see the sword of Gomez, called *Innos Zorn* ("Wrath" or "Rage" of Innos). In religious contexts there is the concept of "gerechter Zorn" (just rage/wrath), that is often attributed to saints or god himself. It is *Innos* who is thought to be *angry*, who wants rage; while Beliar is the one who is executing it in form of punishment in accordance with Innos' will, see [*Will of the gods*](#the-will-of-the-gods).

In order to propagate the cult of fire (whose priests originated from the ancient priests but split into different cults), the priests of fire have started to identify *Innos* with *Ra* in their preachings since a few centuries, but it was under the reign of Rhobar I. that this identification was brought to an end and that the two gods finally merged in the public perception. Rhobars establishment as a quasi divine ruler and the declaration of his realm as a successor of the first empire, proven by bearing the holy insignia (the Sceptre of Varant), was the final seal of this fusion. 

In course of this, the traditional aspects of *Innos*, of fire, justice and war, have become the prevailing attributes in the general understanding of the god, while the aspects of *Ra* have experienced a decline. Among scholars who learned the older language, the old name *Ra* is still in use (as in the example of the royal judge in the Comic), but most often used interchangeably with *Innos*. 

And while the Cult of Myrtana identifies *Innos* with *Ra*, some heretical movements refuse this identification; similar to the gnostics they see *Innos*, as worshipped in the cult of the three gods, as a malevolent lesser god and demiurg in difference to the divine Absolute.

Just as Beliar is not simply "evil", Innos is not just "good"; they are all "part of the equation" (Mike). 


### Beliar, Vandras or Kasakk

*Flosha, 09.09.2024*

Beliar - also known as *Vandras* from an earlier version of the *Lore of the Gods* and as *Kasakk* in the novel - is the god of the death, god of darkness, creator of the night, responsible for punishment and the shadows. He is not meant to just be "the evil", nor was Innos meant to just be "the good". 

> Mike: This was also one of those internal conflicts. [...] "He will go to Beliars realm" does not mean to go to hell, but just to go into the realm of the dead, was my original idea. That is what I wanted to have. [Mike, 30.01.2021](https://gothicarchive.org/postrelease/interviews/MikeHoge_30_01_2021_Part3.html#Mythology)
 
**Beliar**: *Belial* or *Beliar* are Hebrew and speculated to stem from two roots, which mean as much as "without" and "to be useful" or "of value", resulting in a literal meaning of "worthlessness", "uselessness" or "ruin". It has also been interpreted as "never to rise", like a downward movement or "wicked". In the scriptures, Beliar is used as a general phrase of despise. A "son of Beliar" is just a characterisation as "a worthless, wicked, useless" man. 

In the Talmud it is explained as "without the yoke" or "yokeless". In this context we have to think of *yoga*, which also means *yoke*, in the sense of *union* or *unification* (of life, just as the yoke unites two bulls); Beliar would then be the opposite, the *Disuniter*, ayoga; which again we could interpret in a metaphysical sense in the context of a disjunction of body and soul upon death, for which Beliar is responsible. 

> In my idea of the lore it has always been so, that this God-Satan story does not exist in the religious world of Gothic, but all the gods were important. And there were specific attributes ascribed to them. And insofar it should be the so that Beliar too had his followers. [Mike, 30.01.2021](https://gothicarchive.org/postrelease/interviews/MikeHoge_30_01_2021_Part3.html#4Temple)

In one of the Dead Sea scrolls, titled *The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness*, Belial is characterised as "the leader of the Sons of Darkness", which are also described as the *army of Belial*. 

> You made Belial for the pit, angel of enmity; in darkness is his domain, his counsel is to bring about wickedness and guilt. All the spirits of his are angels of destruction, they walk in the laws of darkness; towards it goes their only desire. 

In the "Rules of the Community", Belial is described to control a large number of demons, but demons which are *"specifically allotted to him by God for the purpose of performing evil"*. Belial is here *"established as the force occupying the opposite end of the specrtrum of God"*. 

In the *Fragments*, Belial is *"sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel"*. The same fragments of scrolls also say, that *"anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a necromancer and a wizard"*. 

It is unclear why Beliar was not given up as a name for the same reasons as Ra may have been given up, due to so many real-life religious implications. I can only assume that apparently they liked these implications as much that it justified keeping the name.  

Belial also plays an important role in modern occultism such as in the writings of Aleister Crowly in *Goetia* (1904). In *The Book of Belial* (one of the four books of the so called *Satanic Bible* by Anton LaVey), the name is explained to mean "without a master" (like the word anarchy), and symbolises "independence, self-sufficiency, and personal accomplishment". In this sense, he is like a god of anarchy. 

As to where the name may have been taken from: If not from the original historical sources listed above: Mike mentioned in interviews that he was inspired by *Dungeon Keeper* from 1997. In the expansion *The Deeper Dungeons*, *Belial* is the name of the final level. Filler may have known this too. Beliar is also mentioned in *Paradise Lost*, the epic poem by John Milten. And "Paradise Lost" is one of the names in the list by Dieter Hildebrandt of potential names for Gothic.

**Vandras**: In Sanskrit, *vandra* means to praise, to worship. Based on *vandra* from Old Norse *vondr*, meaning wander or roam, it could mean as much as the "wanderer". *Van* in Sanskrit has the meaning of "sound", but also "to serve" and "to honour", but also "to be distressed". *Vanaya* means "to act", "to hurt", "to kill". It could also be speculated to be somehow related to the *Vandals*, which in a moderng meaning, in the sense of "vandalism", are associated with destruction due to their sack of Rome in 455. Since about the 17th century during the Enlightenment, the Romans were idealised and the Goths and Vandals were blamed for the fall of Rome. In the *Encyclopaedia Britannica" *vandal* has been described as "willful destroyer of what is beautiful or venerable". Etymologically it may also be derived from the Proto-germanic root *wand-* (water). See Old English *wendelsÇ£* or Old High German *wentilsÄo* (meaning vandal-sea - the mediterranean sea). Also *Vendras*, spanish for "you will come", from *venir* (to come). Or Romanian *vandras*, "a tramp".  

By summarising all of these findings and by putting all of those meanings together in a way that serves the lore, we could characterise Beliar/Vandras to be a vagrant, always wandering god, who wants to be worshipped and will bring destruction and distress when not being praised, when not being accepted, when not followed during his wandering into the night and as such a wanderer he may be well associated with the moon; he is the disuniter who brought the night and death as a necessity of life. See [lore of the gods](#lore-of-the-gods) for more.  

---

**Kasakk**: Sanskrit *kasakka*, "tie firmly". *Kazakh* was speculated to originate from the fusion of different clans, such as "Khaz" and "Sak". *Kaz* or *kas* means "free", "brave" and "man" in all turkic languages. In our moraic and orcish etymology, "ak" means as much as "from" or "descending from". Kasakk could in this sense mean as much as a "free descendant".  

*This part about Kasakk is written by Avallach*

**Kasakk** is only mentioned in the Gothic Novel (*Sleeper's Ban*), and he is the only deity appearing there. He appears to be the deity of the realm of the dead, similarly to Beliar from the release version. 

> until they go to Kasakk's realm at some point, simply because they forget to eat or breathe or drink or whatever

Despite being a dark god, he appears to be the only one worshipped by people in the story, drawing parallel with *Crom* from the universe of *Conan the Barbarian*

> in Kasakk's name, leave me alone please!
> thank Kasakk they are not organized
> He really deserved it, in Kasakk's name
> Kasakk put copper on the eyes of three of our men [they died]
> by Kasakk's stinking heap!
> for Kasakk's sake, let's get out of here
> Kasakk, Kasakk? Right, there was this little god, I remember


### Adanos, Adrastos or Cyvanis

*Flosha, 09.09.2024*

Adanos is the god of balance, he stands for healing, work, knowledge, curiosity, courage and is represented by water. This aspect of "balance" between the two forces of Innos and Beliar, like the water that fills up evenly without distinction, always horizontal, always flowing down, was among Mikes original ideas.

In the manual and also at some places in the design documentation, they used to fall back into a simplified good/evil terminology. But to do the early ideas justice, it is important to see his role not as a balance between god and evil, but between a more complex form of balance as in the philosophy of yin & yang, that are both necessary; a clear good/evil dichotomy should be avoided. Innos and Beliar are indeed about a duality, a duality like light and dark, of activity & passivity, of giving and receiving; but they are both *needed* and form a "unity of opposites". 

Just as the indian cults of the gods as all these aspects of Brahman, the Absolute, is hard to grasp for the western mind and widely misunderstood as a "polytheism", yin & yang, while about a duality, are not about a contrast of mutually exclusive forces, but they are part of the equation, they are one, the two sides of a coin or a wheel (think of the wheel of the dharma). And it is Adanos who lets the wheel roll, taking care that it doesn't fall unto one of the sides. 

If the documentation says otherwise, then we see this as a regression for simplicity's sake in the context of the internal design documentation, that Mike had wanted to avoid to present as such in the game; and in any has to be avoided by us, due to how [Gothic was defined](/vision/gothic-defined). 

Innos brought light, Beliar brought the night. Both broth life that couldn't exist without both. But Beliar brought dead too. The negation of life. And Adanos, inbetween, brought healing. 

> *Adanos saw, that the humans were dying and that it was the will of Beliar. And he said: I will not stand against the will of Beliar, but I will give humankind the power of healing." [G]


**Adanos**: Sanskrit *Ada* has several different pronounciations, all coming with a different meaning: 

> Ada, eating, devouring.
> ÄdÄ* means "to receive, accept, take, resort to, seize, take hold of", also "to imprison". 
> Äá¸a (à¤à¤¡).âf An obstinate resisting or insisting upon: also a point maintained of opposition or difficulty. 
> ada (à¤à¤¦).âa Half. 
> adÄ (à¤à¤¦à¤¾).âm The airs and arts of coquetry. Fund. Income.

TODO: Also look up *Adonis*, *adenoid*.

Also see *anos* (years, age) and "ad"? Sanskrit *adhi* "near", latin *ad* "to, toward"; from this also Old English "aet", or modern English "at". *Ad-anos* would then mean as much as "near time", "at the time", "at the age", which could be interpreted as the god of the presence or the god of time. 

> "ad- Motion or direction to; reduction or change into; addition, increase, or intensification."

Also see *ada*+*nos*. *Nos*, latin "we, us". Adhah, sanskrit "down, under, below", from there "Adhara, "ground, foundation" and "Adhana", sanskrit "without possessions". Ada+nos could then be something like "below us", "under us", or "the foundation of us" or "we without any possession" or whatever. 

In Hebrew, *Adha* means "ornament". 

**Adrastos**: Greek mythology, á¼Î´ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï ("Adrastus") may mean "the inescapable". A king of Argos. Adrastus was mentioned in the *Iliad* of Homer and has been depicted in art already in the 6th century BC; there is too much to write about him, but not much that seems relevant for the god in question.  

**Cyvanis**: [TODO]

## Lore of the Gods

An ingame book in Gothic consisting of three volumes.  
Below we will quote the entire book alongside our commentary. 

> HÃ¶re die Worte der GÃ¶tter, denn es ist ihr Wille, dass sie gehÃ¶rt werden. Befolge die Lehren der GÃ¶tter, denn es ist ihr Wille, dass sie befolgt werden. Achte die Priester der GÃ¶tter, denn sie sind erwÃ¤hlt.

13.06.2024: The first volume is more moral in character, the second volume deals with the creation of the world and life and the third volume establishes the superiority of priesthood and talks of the "fall of magic". From this general layout we can deduce a primarily moral intention and focus of the scripture.  

25.03.2024: It seems that mythological and historical records are melting together in the books, alongside a ideological colouration of the author, which is obviously a priest of fire based on his negative description of the circle of water, of which he writes that they *"... directed their prayers to Adanos and forgot their origin"*. 

13.06.2024: It is also important to notice, that inspite of the authors ideological bias against the Adanos cult, he clearly demands in Volume I to "follow the will of the gods" in plural and to respect the priests in general, which includes the priests of Adanos. 

Due to these characteristics we can deduce that the book was written during the time of the "second Realm", after the reconciliation of the house of Innos and the house of Adanos under Rhobar.


### The Will of the Gods

*Flosha, 13.06.2024*

> Die Worte Innos: Und mÃ¶get ihr nicht verstehen, so zweifelt nicht an den Worten der Priester, ihr Tun ist gerecht und weise. Denn ich bin die aufgehende Sonne, das Licht und das Leben. Und alles was da wider der Sonne, ist wider mir und soll verbannt sein auf immer und ewig in die Schatten.  
> Die Worte Adanos: Arbeite und lebe, denn der Tag ist gemacht dafÃ¼r, dass der Mensch arbeite. Suche das Lernen und Wissen, auf dass Du es weitergeben kannst, denn so bist Du geschaffen worden. Wer aber mÃ¼Ãig und faul, der soll verbannt werden auf immer und ewig in die Schatten.  
> Die Worte Beliars: Wer aber handelt unrecht und gegen den Willen der GÃ¶tter, den will ich strafen, den KÃ¶rper mit Schmerz, Leid und Tod, den Geist werde ich aber zu mir nehmen auf immer und ewig in die Schatten. [G]

Summarising the words of the gods, the first volume is stating that Innos and Adanos want those to be banished into the shadows who act against them. The words of Beliar are not in any kind of conflict with the words of Innos or Adanos, but are confirming them: 

> "But who acts unrighteous and against the will of the gods, he I shall punish."

This characterises Beliar as the god of justice and the death. He is a dark god, not an evil god. And that is how Mike had conceptualised him. 


### Creation Myth

*Flosha, 13.06.2024*

> Vom Anbeginn der Zeit: Es ward noch kein Tag oder Nacht und kein Wesen zog Ã¼ber die Welt. Da erschien der Welt Innos und sein Licht erhellte alles. Und Innos schenkte der Welt das Leben. Da aber kein Wesen im Licht des Innos leben kann, schuf er die Sonne. Das Licht war aber noch zu stark. Da teilte sich Innos und schuf Beliar. Beliar brachte die Nacht. Nun konnten die Menschen sein. Da teilte sich Innos erneut und schuf Adanos. Adanos gab den Menschen die Vielseitigkeit, Wissen, Neugier und Mut. Innos war sehr zufrieden mit sich und seinem Werk. 
> Und er beschloss die Menschen Adanos ganz zu Ã¼berlassen, um zu ruhen. [G] 

As the script is most likely written by a priest of Innos, Ra does not appear as a name, but based on the analysis above, we can as well replace him with Ra to get a better picture. 

"There was no day yet nor night and no being wandered on the world." Speaking of a time before existence. 

"There appeared Innos to the world and his light illuminated everything. And Innos gave life to the world." Everything was still one and everything was light, this was the beginning of the universe. 

"But since no being could live in the light of Innos, he created the sun." Thus, the light was bundled, focused, concentrated into a perceived center of the universe. 
 
"But the light was still too strong. There Innos divided itself and created Beliar." The underlying unity of existence had to create duality to enable reality, to enable realisation; nothing could realise the light without darkness; duality was a necessity for life. 

So Beliar, formerly called *Vandras*, described as the "God of Darkness", "the dark God", originated or emanated from Ra as a necessity, as life could not be in the light of Ra without darkness, he "who brought the night"; it is due to him that man could be and realise god on earth/in himself. He is God of justice and the death, in the realm of the "Shadows" in which everyone ends.

Adanos, also known as "Cyvanis" and "Adrastos", originated after Beliar from the same common source and is associated with the evolution of humanity into the supreme species it considers itself to be; in that he gave man... 
* diversity (different tribes, cultures, nations)
* knowledge (the development of self-consciousness and intellect)
* curiosity (the driving force of exploration) and
* courage (to conquer and rule the world "given" to them) 


### The Necessity of Death

*Flosha & logx, 28.07.2020*

> Beliar aber wurde von Neid zerfressen, denn die Menschen beteten nicht zu ihm und ruhten des Nachts. Da wurde er zornig und er formte sich einen Menschen. Einen Menschen, der nur ihn anbeten sollte. Der Mensch aber ward genau so wie alle anderen Menschen. Beliar wurde so stark von Zorn erfÃ¼llt, dass er den Menschen tÃ¶tete und sprach: Wenn sie mich nicht anbeten, dann sollen sie mich fÃ¼rchten. Und er schuf den Tod und nahm den Menschen das Leben. [G]

Durch ihre UnfÃ¤higkeit zur IntegralitÃ¤t (von Licht und Dunkelheit, Sichtbarem und Unsichtbarem, Bewusstem und Unbewusstem, kurz: der DÃ¤monen - so eine mystische Deutung des Mythos), was metaphorisch den Zorn des dunklen Gottes heraufbeschwor, wurden sie sterblich. So leben sie seitdem als âMoraâ (mor â sterblich, vergÃ¤nglich; ra â Gott; âsterblicher Gottâ), in der SphÃ¤re des VergÃ¤nglichen (Morgrad). 

Der Name der Orks in der alten Sprache ist âOrakâ (or â Erde; ak â abstammen). SpÃ¤ter wurde daraus das heute gebrÃ¤uchliche âOrkâ in der Sprache der Menschen. Die Menschen betrachten sich als gÃ¶ttlich und âvon obenâ kommend. Rak = âvon Gottâ oder âvom Himmelâ und im Gegensatz dazu die Orks als von der Erde abstammend und von Erde gemacht = nicht gÃ¶ttlichen Ursprungs.

Gelehrte behaupten, die Orks gingen auf Beliar/Vandras zurÃ¼ck, der einen neuen Menschen aus Erde formte, um ihn anzubeten - und sie taten es auch nicht. Darum bestrafte er sie. Die Menschen betrachten die Orks als entstellt, als GeÃ¤chtete in den Augen der GÃ¶tter [siehe Rassismus in der âGeschichte der Orksâ]. Menschen halten Orks als Sklaven; die Inquisition spielt mit der Angst der Menschen und droht ihnen, entstellt zu werden wie die Orks, wenn sie den GÃ¶ttern nicht gehorchen und Beliar erzÃ¼rnen. Die Orks aber haben ihre eigenen Mythen, die nichts mit der menschlichen GÃ¶tterwelt gemein haben. 


### The first Appropriation of Magic
or: The Great Disentchantment

*Flosha & logx, 28.07.2020*

> Innos gab den Menschen die Macht ihn zu hÃ¶ren und zu ihm zu sprechen. Er gab ihnen die Macht groÃe Wunder zu vollbringen. Und er nannte sie Magie. Mit dieser Macht konnten die Menschen die Welt frei nach ihrem Willen gestalten. Es gab keine Grenzen, die Innos ihnen aufzeigte. Und so hatten die Menschen Teil an der gÃ¶ttlichen SchÃ¶pferkraft. Aber die Menschen waren sich alle gleich und das gefiel ihnen nicht. Also nahm er denen die unzufrieden waren, die Kraft. Die wenigen, die sich dankbar zeigten, stellte Innos Ã¼ber alle anderen.    
> Diese Menschen wurden alsbald verehrt und gefÃ¼rchtet und wurden Priester genannt. [G]

Die Menschen glauben, dass Ra (bzw. Innos, die sie mit ihm identifizieren) den ersten Menschen, die unsterblich waren, die Magie als einen Teil seiner gÃ¶ttlichen SchÃ¶pferkraft gab und dass sie - Kraft der Magie - nahezu gÃ¶ttliche FÃ¤higkeiten zur Gestaltung der Welt hatten. 

Doch der Mythos erzÃ¤hlt, dass sich die Menschen als unwÃ¼rdig erwiesen, weil sie sich alle gleich waren (BedÃ¼rfnis nach IndividualitÃ¤t, DiversitÃ¤t, Ãberlegenheit, Unterschied), so dass Innos den UnwÃ¼rdigen seine Macht (die Magie) wieder entzog und dass er einige wenige als Herrscher Ã¼ber alle anderen stellte: Die Priester.  
Gewisse ketzerische Bewegungen betrachten diesen Teil des Mythos als LÃ¼gen der Priester, um ihre eigene Macht zu legitimieren und den Ausschluss aller anderen von der Magie zu rechtfertigen.

Herrschaft, Gesetz, Licht und Feuer werden traditionell Ra zugeschrieben. Unter der FÃ¼hrung jener damals noch nicht gespaltenen Priester grÃ¼ndeten diese ersten Menschen, von denen die Ãberlieferung spricht, ein mÃ¤chtiges Reich (das "erste Reich"): dessen Zentrum das heutige Varant. Als Insignie der unumschrÃ¤nkten Herrschaft Ã¼ber die StÃ¤mme von Varant und die Welt trug der oberste Priester des Ersten Reiches einen Stab mit angeblich gÃ¶ttlichen KrÃ¤ften zur Beherrschung der SphÃ¤ren. Man nennt ihn spÃ¤ter das "Zepter von Varant".


### Cultic Wars & the Decline of Faith

*Flosha, 25.03.2024*

> ... wurden Priester genannt. Doch auch unter ihnen gab es viele, die bald unzufrieden waren. Und so kam es, dass sie zu Adanos beteten und ihren Ursprung vergaÃen. Die Riege der Priester war gespalten. Kriege wurden entfesselt und auch der Glaube an die gÃ¶ttliche Allmacht war bald schon nur noch Mythos. So teilten sich die Priester. Die dem Adanos folgten nannte man nun Magier des Wassers, die Geweihten des Innos hieÃen aber die Magier des Feuers. [G]

The scripture informs us that cultic wars were started in course of the split of the priests and that apparently the belief in the allmightiness of god became a myth.  
We can interpret this to suggest that atheism and other faiths gained popularity.  
Rhobar I. took measures against this decline of faith and the cultic disputes with the proclamation of the faith in the three gods, in order to reconcile the houses of Innos and Adanos and by acquiring the Sceptre of Varant, claiming himself to be the governor of the highest god RA, identified with Innos, in order to set himself into a lineage of the old realm.  
Rhobar II. later established the Inquisition as another measure, as a representation of Beliars justice. 


## Cults of Myrtana

Within Myrtana, "religion" (a word that should not appear anywhere ingame) is practiced in form of *Cults* in the sense of the cults of antiquity, such as the mystery cults of ancient Greece. Accordingly, there are no "churches" in Myrtana, but temples. 

There is a cult of Innos, a cult of Adanos and a cult of Beliar. There may be other cults too, but these are the prevailing ones. Myrtana under the rule of Rhobar II. propagates the *Cult of the Three Gods*. The myrtanian people believe in the three gods and in their role in the grand scheme of life, but at some places the worship of Innos prevails, while at other places, more followers of Adanos are to be found. But no devotee of one of the gods would ever negate the existence of another. 

Just as Innos and Adanos, Beliar has dedicated followers too, but no sacrifices are offered to him and no public worship is taking place; the cultic practice of the followers of Beliar is done in secrecy, since the worship of Beliar is condemned by the priests. While there are priests of Innos and Adanos, there are no priests of Beliar and the magic assigned to Beliar, such as the summoning of demons, is banned and considered as heresy.

The *clergy* of Myrtana is thus divided into the priests of fire and the priests of water (which are organised in *circles*), while as a whole, as the communities of followers, they are described as the "House of Innos" and the "House of Adanos". Similar to what in Christianity would be described as the Roman-Catholic or Protestant or Orthodox Church etc. Just that here they were reconciled in form of the Cult of the three Gods, something like an ecumenical movement of Myrtana. 


### Cult of the Three Gods

*Flosha, 13.06.2024*

> *"the proclaimer of the faith into the three gods and representative of the highest god Ra"* [C]

With the founding of the empire, Rhobar I. attempted to reconcile the disputes of the priests by the proclamation of the faith in the three gods. There are other cults in the kingdom. But since Rhobar I. the *Cult of the Three Gods* is "states religion".

Priests are consecrated both to Innos and Adanos, but not to Beliar. At least - not anymore at the time of the new empire during which the story takes place. 

> [...] zu oberst stand *Innos*, der Gott der Sonne und des Gesetzes, der als erster und hÃ¶chster Gott verehrt wurde und dessen Priester die Magier des Feuers waren. Die
Priester des Gottes *Adanos* [...] waren die Magier des Wasserkreises, nur dem
Gott der Dunkelheit und des Todes, *Beliar*, waren keine Priester geweiht, denn seine MÃ¤chte waren von finsterer Natur. [M]

The belief in the gods, while it may be in decline (and the reverence for the gods may be the lowest in a place like the colony), is still very popular within Myrtana and we can quote several mentionings from within the colony too.

> *The Mages in the New Camp are planning something with the magical barrier. The Gods may protect us.* (Secret Thieves, 0.56c)

> *Today I will succeed. I know it. The Gods help me. [...] Today I will kill a troll.* [G]

> Rigaldo: *May Innos protect us.* [G]

> Until my body goes to Beliars realm and extinguishing is the fire of life. [G]

<!-- Magic is still thought to be a gift of the gods; even if it cannot be proven. A title of a book that was not written, is talking of the "Divine Gift" (GÃ¶ttergabe), related to the first circle, refering to magic or the "Arcane". There is a melee weapon called "GÃ¶tterhammer" (hammer of the gods). -->

There are also other local deities and believes in different corners of the realm, such as the shamanism of the orcs and specific movements considered as heretical by the royal clergy, such as the *Brotherhood of the Sleeper*. 

### Sect of the Sleeper

We will deal with the sect in the faction documentation. For here it has to suffice to note, that the entrance into the sect is accompanied by a radical and conscious renounciation of the three gods, that they also call the "old gods". 

> Wir haben den alten GÃ¶ttern abgeschworen. [G]

> Novice: Pray for the last time to your gods. [A]

The priests of the cult still assume that their magical (psionic) power has to have a source in some kind of god, because they do not know or cannot imagine a magic unrelated to a higher, divine (or demonic) source. 

> [...] The brotherhood is a threat. A threat for the proceeding of our trade agreement and thus for the King, the entire kingdom and also for your life. Therefore you should send out scouts and find out, on which gods and on which knowledge their magical power is based. If you figured this out, we will inform the priests of your findings, so that together we can bring an end to this phantom. [...] [G]
